234|Looking for a master of art| There is a long-standing art association in the holy emblem city, but with the vigorous development of various organizations, the organization has gradually been unable to respond to market changes and decline. Due to poor performance, the Holy See is about to cancel the subsidy next month, and the association will also be closed down. The purpose of the association-the promotion of ancient and modern art and culture, will no longer be realized...

 At this time, as the ninth generation of the <Art Association President> Yijibang, in order to revive the prosperity of the organization, came up with a wild idea, that is to directly invite ancient and modern art masters to hold a grand art festival! He learned about the existence of the Space-Time Enchantment through friends in the Holy See Library, so with the help of the Holy See Magicians, he successfully summoned the Space-Time Enchantment in the sky above the Holy Emblem City!

 Because the art festival is full of gimmicks, the holy emblem city is crowded with people. But the biggest highlight-the invited art masters have not been seen for a long time. At the same time, due to lack of manpower, tourists cannot get timely assistance.
