1|Aven|Aven, the Holy City, built of glimmering ivory and blue stone, is located 
on an island in the middle of a lake.

It's a peaceful place, removed from the strife plaguing the rest of the
 continent. Thus, its library has amassed a vast collection of texts. 

Religion unites the city and maintains its neutrality despite the wars 
surrounding it. The Pope of Meterol Curia currently presides over it.|Pier|City Hall|Courthouse|Temple Knights' Hall|Industrial Ward|Trading District|Market Zone|Market Zone|Market Zone|The Island Sanctuary|
2|Limestone Mtn.|Limestone Mtn. is known for its rich veins of ore, first discovered by 
Andrew, a Geologist. The area developed into a major mining town, and 
labyrinthine tunnels now criss-cross the entire mountain.

Andrew Village is famous for the rare, blue crystals found there. Solid, 
radient, and highly prized, these crystals provide villagers a wealth of 
business opportunities.|Andrew Village|Waterwheel Cottage|Cerilia Forest|Angor Quarry||||||Daring to Dream|
3|Tranquil Hill|Tranquil Hill's Seabell is located along the picturesque Starry Coast. Its
location makes it an important port-of-call for many ships, creating a lively
economy filled with bargains, rare items, and even the new and strange. 

Most residents' daily lives are connected to the sea in some way. The town's
unique cuisine has attracted many tourists, and business is booming all around.|Seabell|Starry Coast|Camina Ranch|Looted Caravan|Ransacked Camp|Fort Verdure (DGN)||||The Beginning of Wisdom|
4|Rainbowfall Forest|Travelers visit Rainbowfall Forest for its beautiful waterfall and warm
hospitality.The water flows year-round, making the mountain look as if it's
been draped with silk. The mist it stirs up casts rainbows on the rocks.

Numerous falls feed the crystal-clear Prismata. The relics of lost
civilizations stand scattered around it, lending the forest a mysterious air.|Opera|Lull Meadow|Prismata|Bicid Bog|Tasos Channel (DGN)|||||Passion and Parity|
5|Goss Mountains|The weather around Goss Mountain is scorching year-round. Only the 
hardiest of plants take root in its parched soil. Fierce sandstorms swirl 
through the rocky landscape, and ferocious animals make survival even more difficult.

Legends say an ancient dragon sleeps in the desert, and Cenana's leader
believesa civilization once thrived underground. No one knows whether these
tales are fact or fiction.|Cenana|Wyndir|Nikola's Laboratory|Zelena Camp|Shale Cavern|Eroda (DGN)||||The Vapid Miasma|
6|Beluga Bay|Beluga Harbor is a port as renowned as Seabell. Surrounded by
cliffs and subject to frequent storms, docking isn't always easy. 
To help guide ships in safely, the town built a lofty lighthouse.

Towering walls ring the city in layers, guarding against potential attacks.
This has allowed the harbor to remain prosperous even during harassment from
pirates and tribal bandits.|Beluga Harbor|Morticora|Azul Relics|Vilesharks' Camp|Scalen Woods|Vileshark HQ (DGN)||||An Ensconced Harbor|
7|Wetlands|Over time, the springs dotting this flat landscape turned it into a 
marshland. Moss and lichen grow in profusion, blanketing even the 
ancient ruins still standing. 

It's said that a powerful magician lived here as a hermit, then vanished without
a trace. The magic he left behind altered the region's creatures, resulting in
strange and enlarged flora and fauna.|Wayward Camp|Branda Root (DGN)|Colden Pools|Malice Palace Ruins|Nair|Simulacrum||||The Soultree Everglades|
8|Valley of Kings|Deep in the green and prosperous Valley of Kings, five waterfalls form a
beautiful lake. The breathtaking scenery is a major draw for tourism.

Many generations of renowned Kings have been laid to rest here, lending the
valley its name. Their statues and relics fill the land. The Curia people value
it so much, they tasked the ancient Torturras with protecting it.|Garden|Dalia Tower|Du'loth|Desanti Falls|Carmela Gang|Ulta Corridor|Ulta Hall (DGN)|Rotten (DGN)||Remnants of the Past|
9|Avila Volcano|Surrounded by volcanoes, this is a land of fire; burning ash drifts through 
the air, and even the soil has a red hue. The sulfrous lava pools bubbling 
to the surface keep the ground so hot, no one dares tread on it barefoot.

Despite this, the Tuskars have managed to create a thriving civilization here.
Powerful and courageous, they built their capital city, Baltaroi, by the
volcano's crater.|Loto|Bloodletter's Weald|Baram's Chasm (DGN)|Rasys|Baltaroi Core (DGN)|Baltaroi||||The Obsidian Graveyard |
10|Golden Plains|Golden Plains is a boundless grassland with mirror-smooth rivers and 
temperate weather. Farming, transportation, and even hot-air balloon 
travel have seen rapid development here.

The ease of communication across this flat landscape led many to settle here.
The excellent location encourages commerce, and many traveling merchants pass
through the prosperous capitol, Golden City.|Golden City|Sam's Mirage|Saken Forest|Sanity's Ascent|Wolfeye Gang Camp|Veninfang (DGN)||||The Grassland Crossroads|
11|Arid Wilds|Sandstorms whip through this parched, barren desert. Bleached bones 
and dead trees scatter the landscape, and water is more precious than gold. 
The Amur Kingdom once thrived here, but the ruins of the King's City are all that is left.

The desolation has turned the place into a crime-filled den of thieves. In such
a harsh environment, mining is the only other profitable trade for locals.|Boulder|Veraldar|Slain (DGN)|Baira's Chamber|Desert Rats' Base|Dianack (DGN)|Chroe's Altar|||What Slumbers Beneath?|
12|Delphi Forest|Ancient, leafy plants fill this tropical forest. Mist and steam pour off of 
hot springs in the north, giving the region a mystical quality.

Sadly, Ogres felled many trees for wood to use in weapons-making for the wars. 
They not only clearcut acres of trees, but diverted rivers and left dry channels
behind. The Delphi Forest lost its glory, and its native animals became
aggressive and dangerous.|Delphi|Etalia Geyser|Crypticone|Crekkin|Pross Dig Site|Lumberin|Crimson (DGN)|Delphi Temple (DGN)||The Weeping Wildwood|
13|Blackflame Peak|Blackflame Peak hulks in the northwest, spewing scalding lava and soot-
colored rock. Rain is rare, and water precious. The Toroto Kingdom maintains 
a huge fort here, surrounded by charred columns and petrified wood. Even miles away,
its presence feels overwhelming.

Anvil stands nearby. Residents are experts in many ores and craft a variety 
of weapons from them...this becomes Toroto's arsenal.|Anvil|Stella Mines|Crooked Vein (DGN)|Mara Cult Altar (DGN)|Ladelir Outpost|Century (DGN)||||Stygian Aiguille Asunder|
14|Decay Swamp|Sweltering and humid year-round, aquatic plants thrive here--almost as 
well as mosquitoes. Isolated from the outside world, residents of Bonmalmo 
have developed a distinct culture. 

They believe the most powerful god, the King of Earth, lives in Gullock Swamp,
and that they share a deep bond with him. The nearby Wrathbone Tribe harasses 
them constantly with all manner of evil magic.|Bonmalmo|Gullock Swamp|Soulmor Falls (DGN)|Wrathbone Tribe|Gust|Explorers' Campsite|Vortek (DGN)|||Traditions Live On|
15|Highlands|Mountains ring this sunny highland, their wooded slopes abloom with 
flowers and fruit trees. Butterflies and magical creatures are both common 
sights.

In ancient times, the Kingdom of Tyrol controlled this area; historians are keen
to learn about their ruins west of the woodland. The Valencia Union
built their Lion's Fort beside a lake here, successfully defending against 
countless armies.|Tyrol Ruins|Beryl Ranch|Lion's Fort|Hawkeye Outpost|Tyrol Steps|Federal Armory (DGN)|Asheos|Manor (DGN)||Valencia's Territory|
16|Ursun Paw Mtns|On the east side of the central continent lies a mountain range. Upon the 
highest peak, known as Lodestone Mountain, an Ursun village formed. 

Obsidian rock and crystal compose this peak. It possesses magentic power; this 
causes rocks to hover in the sky as if by magic.

The rift valley, cliff, and suspension bridges  provide a training ground for martial artists. 
Rare plants grow here, as well.|Karuditon|Lodestone Mtn.|Wellspring Mtn.|Forgotten Valley|The Way of Ardor|||||Battlefist's Origin|
18|Mayor's Room|This is where the Mayor of Golden City both works and rests. Burdened 
with dozens of responsibilities, he often works until midnight, his desk 
buried under paperwork.

One day, his secretary, Camille, found him asleep at his desk and unable to
be roused. With the Mayor in a coma, troubles have piled up in Golden City.||||||||||Statesman's Shelter|
19|Fegeral Valley|Fegeral Valley is a patchwork of fertile farmland stitched together by 
rivers. Many Zumi have settled here. The rubble of several ancient 
peoples dots the landscape, and much ancient technology is buried nearby. 

In the southwest, Corossa is devoted to the study of ancient civilizations.
Residents have developed many advanced machines and powerful devices based on
ancient technology.|Corossa|Ghasia|Torelia|Seren's Meadow|Tunnel Remains|||||Cradle of Machinery|
20|Sunset Desert|The sands of this expansive desert reflect the golden rays of the setting 
sun--the breathtaking vista that gave the desert its name. The river wending 
through has irrigated a lush Oasis on its banks, forming a habitat for a 
cornucopia of wildlife.

Nearby, a research institute contrasting the local scenery is staffed by a group
of Zumi scientists studying explosive waves.|Silus Institute|Roam Plateau|Twilight Bramble|Ruined Institute|Troi|||||Golden Dusk|
21|Skyreach Jungle|Look! It's a bird, or a plane, or... a flying boat? 

Skyreach Jungle is the biggest airship port on the Southwest Continent and an
important commercial hub. It's the go-to location for newbies looking to hone
their skills and has spawned the best mechanics in the field.

Recently, the Gates Corsairs launched an attack, destroying a lot of the 
infrastructures and taking over the airship port. Overnight, the important airship port
took a turn for the worse. The airship industry is in jeopardy.|Etin Airport|Deserted Factory|Downy Airport|Bull's Workshop|Rott Crater|||||A Dream of the Skies|
22|Witchcraft Forest|A special energy within this land gives all its animals and plants an 
ethereal glow. This radiance attracts adventurers and tourists alike.

Witchcraft Nexus built an institute, the Colossal Cauldron, to research the energy. 
However, beasts attempt to steal the energy and force out the scientists. 

Valencia soldiers set up camp southeast of the forest to protect the travelers and researchers. |Frontier Camp|House of Whispers|Foxfire Trail|Cubuquah|Colossal Cauldron|Sturmfrau||||Unyielding Tempest|
23|Gemsis Ridge|A cluster of crystal pillars stands in the center of a lake. The ancient Kaia 
Tribe has dwelled in this oasis for hundreds of years. They welcome travelers.

Adventurers erected a camp across the lake from the tribe. Explorers come from around
 the globe to snatch up glittering treasures from the lake's bottom. With time, the camp has 
become a well-equipped respite for eager treasure hunters. |New Moon Altar|Kaia Tribe|Miracle Mount|Baalu Camp|Palm Forest|Pitfall Rift||||The Oasis|
24|Shiver Peak|None survive long on this isolated mountain, where the crunch of fresh, 
pure snow covers broken weapons and footprints of those who tried to 
brave the bitter cold.

In the south lies Nolengrew, a shelter for the Nolan heros who tried to defeat brutal beasts 
and save their fellow man.

To the northwest of the village sits the monsters' lair. No one dares go near it.|Nolengrew|Dulong Ruins|Belaya Lake|Starfrost Forest|Windsnap Lair|Icethorne Road|Ruined Camp|Glacial Wall - Dulong Fortress||Snow's Surrender Plateau|
25|Death Valley|Shriveled trees fill this lifeless mud pit. The few who choose to dwell 
here must brave harsh conditions. Every day is a battle to survive to see 
the next one.

Those who live in this forsaken area rarely develop meaningful relationships, 
even with their family members. To them, life is not about love; it's about survival.
|Dust Tribe|Blistered Quagmire|Grimrock Forest|Ire's Eye Camp|Greyview Hollow|Guillotine||||Reaper Valley|
26|Eyebloom Plain|This plateau is located northwest of the central mainland, surrounded by 
mountains. Flowers known as "Eyeblooms" spill across the land. Eyeblooms 
glow in the dark, casting a warm light over the entire area. 

Locals make money selling Eyeblooms. However, another type of flower is slowly edging out the Eyeblooms; 
the Eyeblooms could face extinction. This would threaten the locals' livelihoods.

27|Tempest Cliff|The angry, constant waves of the ocean formed this cliff. The hardest rock 
doesn't stand a chance against a lifetime of vicious currents beating against it.
 
The famous Rose Knights chose to build their Rose Temple here. The cliff is now 
a popular tourist destination, and locals take pride in hosting the Rose Knights.|Kalouma|Aurora Trail|Bleaksand Beach|Dusktide Cavern|Roseborough|Lookout Lighthouse|Bloodbattle Camp|||Rose Knight's Origin|
28|Graceland Marsh|Graceland Marsh is a land of wonder and home to the Anurans. The cool 
mist throughout all four seasons of the year and the temperate weather 
leads many travelers to stay a while. 

Almost every race has its own dwellings here among the trees. In the center 
of the marsh is the Holy Tree, Rando. This Holy Tree has watched the marshland 
for generations, like a great grandparent. The Anuran make use of this sacred 
site in their initiation rituals.

29|Cyclone Basin|The ocean waves slam into the walls of Hurricane Harbor but cannot 
shake the city. As one of the most important hubs of the southeast, 
Hurricane Harbor can withstand the strongest wind and waves.   

Just outside of the Harbor, on Tainan Hill, there is a tornado-shaped tower. 
The cold, mystic energies of the tower make its white walls shimmer. 
Is this port in for a major storm warning?|Hurricane Harbor|Tydani Crash Trail |Samestra|Cyclone Summit|Kristalwald|Plackton||||Gatherer of Winds|
30|Viper's Forest|After the appearance of the red light, new dangers emerged in Viper's 
Forest. Venomous beasts attacked merchants, and the cannibal tribe 
began to hunt travelers. At the end of the road, one finds the well-equipped 
Wayward Explorers' Camp, the only safe place in the forest.

These dangers did not stop explorers from seeking the ruins of Aziz near the mysterious 
square pyramid.

31|Sakura Island|This deserted island was discovered by the explorer Yupie, and was once 
a scene of mighty battles and bloodshed. After many years, this quiet island 
has become a favorite location for weddings, friendly contests, and peace 
reigns among the cherry blossoms.||||||||||A Quiet Sanctuary|
32|Searing Valley|Searing Valley sits between two volcanic mountains. These volcanos lend 
a unique feel to the environment; it feels like autumn year-round, and the 
air carries the heady smell of cinnamon and dried leaves. Also, the soil in 
the area is enriched with volcanic minerals; thus, unique plant life has 
sprung up around the area.

The hot springs nearby are a bloody red due to the infestation of bacteria from the volcanos. 
Water vapor from these hot springs creates a thick, white layer of fog that rarely lifts.

Because Searing Valley is near the border of two countries, Toroto has sent troopers to patrol the area, hoping to avoid any sort of war. 
A military station up in the mountain range oversees the whole valley. Rumor has it secret experiments are being conducted in this station.|Hunter's Cabin|Mire Ring|Uncharted Cave (DGN)|Gustgate Scout Towers|Vingot Barracks|Vingot Lab|Hallow Canyon|||Greymist Junction|
33|Sunrise Plains|This endless golden plateau is covered in common reeds. Although the 
windmills and watermills are still running, the farmlands are deserted. 
An indestructible defensive wall protects the area from any possible attacks.

The land in the southern side of the city collapsed and sank due to converging tectonic plates. 
The area is covered in craggy pits and, from a distance, looks a bit like a honeycomb. 
These collapsed areas are blocked with chevaux de frise set by the Torotos to prevent monster attacks. 

Enemy troops stationed themselves in the eastern side of the city. They have rations and supplies to last them for years 
as well as a formidable cache of high-tech weaponry. War might break out at any moment.
|Torotoshire|Riot Farm|Toroto Mines|Tectonia|Tectonia Camp|Dragon's Nest Hill||||Plateau Highland|
34|Devastation Realm|Due to the shifting of tectonic plates, the Devastation Realm has 
separated from Toroto. The rift caused catastrophic damage to the 
surrounding environment.

Vile monsters began to emerge from the rift. Thick vines wound their way around rundown buildings, obscurring them completely. 
The evil aura from the Vilespire Temple runs wild in the Devastation Realm. Not a soul dares venture near.

In the middle of this sinister chaos is a magical circle, glowing softly blue amid the wreckage of the area. Inside this circle is a safe house, 
protected from the all the evils of the environment around it. It is the one pure thing left in the Devastation Realm's madness.

35|Toroto Palace|Merely setting foot into this opulent palance will take one's breath away. 
From the glittering gems embedded in the emperor's throne to the rows 
of gleaming armor flanking an impossibly long hallway, every detail in this
incredible mansion is designed to impress, overwhelm, and intimidate. 
A tangible sense of the emperor's supremacy falls over any visitor.

A soaring ceiling in the emperor's main room causes most guests to gasp. It's also known to cause nosebleeds for the poor 
servants who must hoist themselves up to dust the upper corners. Row after row of candlesticks, embelished with sapphire crystals, 
provide a romantic yet eerie light.

Behind the throne hangs a heavily embellished cloth adorned with Toroto's emblem and maps of ancient times. 
These maps reveal the glorious and sprawling nature of the Toroto empire.
||||||||||Toroto's Gathering Chamber|
36|Eloise Plains|The expansive Eloise Plains were once Braider territory. Surrounded on all 
sides by verdant rolling hills, the spacious plain was also the ideal place to 
train new troops. The fertile land provided the Braider Kingdom with copious crops.

However, the land proved difficult to defend. The northern and southern outposts were of the utmost importance, 
and heavily armed guards were assigned to defend them. Slicing through the middle of the plains was a marble 
plank connecting the two outposts.

On either side stood statues of the goddess Eloise. Sadly, a huge meteor recently destroyed the tranquility of 
this plain, shattering the statues and scorching the green earth. The chaos that ensued seems to echo the 
unrest building within the Braider Kingdom itself.|Braider Camp|Union Pathway|Meteor Crater|Eloise Outpost|Netherfell Forest|Lotus Plains|Gowen Mountain Range|||Chivalry Outpost|
37|Hayward Seavale|In the middle of a lake stands Hayward Seavale, the Valencia Union's 
meeting place. Tall, stony walls protect this place - sometimes referred 
to as the union's "Aven" - and the people within.

Hayward Seavale has an established residential zoning plan. At the southernmost point is Plebeian Row, followed 
by the Upper Crust Quarters and the Nobility Realm. Plebeian Row contains a market where merchants from around 
the world hawk their wares, boosting the area's economy. If you head north, you'll hit a more refined area that plays 
host to diplomats and wealthy playboys from around the globe.

Recently, a bizarre magic formation appeared in the town. Scads of vicious creatures lurched forth, forcing the civilians 
to flee for their lives and destroying any and every building in their paths.|Defense Army Temporary Stronghold|Plebeian Row|Upper Crust Quarters|Nobility Realm|Governing District|Rodin Harbor|Yimen Street|Sewage Underpass Exit||Valencia Union's Congressional Chamber |
38|Durango Kingdom|A magic kingdom hovers in the atmosphere - the Durango Kingdom.
At its center is an island that acts as a hub, connecting other, smaller 
islands in a veritable web of land. Stout thorns and towering trees 
grow upon each island.

The main island includes a residential area and the king's regal castle. However, no one occupies either place anymore. 
Throngs of mutant Barbarians loiter there, taking advantage of the sheer emptiness of the place. The column that 
maintains the continent's momentum is a true technological marvel; the Durango Kingdom must have been quite an 
advanced place during its golden age.

No one knows why the citizens of the Durango Kingdom seemingly disappeared, but little is left of their civilization 
except for barren earth, rubble, and a few scattered magical items. The disappearance is quite a conundrum, one that has yet to be solved.|Watcher Organization Encampment|Durango Kingdom Domiciles|Durango Kingdom's Imperial Palace|Nether Crystal Sanctuary|Driftglow Sanctuary|Tianzhu Cloister|Hallowed Prayer Altar|||Ancient Enchanted City|

platform. Knights' armor flanks the sword on either side, guarding the castle.

Eternal Power pulses within the palace walls. Any Eternal Guardian who 
passes through the area will feel this energy pulsing within. The power 
allows the Eternal Guardian to focus entirely on training; outside factors 
will not prove a distraction. ||||||||||Sacred Secret Grounds|
42|Bill's Training Facility|Parkour expert Bill's training course features specialized rough terrain and 
complex obstacles. A great deal of work went into creating this place.

Years ago, Master Bill met a girl with impressive skills; this young lady's swift 
and agile moves made him consider taking on a pupil. She told him her name 
was Yuanron, and after Master Bill exhibited his superlative parkour techniques, 
Yuanron declared her willingness to study alongside him.

Yuanron's talents grew each day; she eagerly soaked up the Master's knowledge. 
Bill created this facility to help her continue to hone her skills.||||||||||This specialized venue was built entirely from heavy, durable metal.|
43|Braider Command Post|After Braider seceded from the Valencia Union and declared war on the 
Toroto Empire, a troop of heavily armed soldiers immediately gathered 
under the rule of King Molman.

Prince Columbia and Princess Paisha led these brutal forces through the 
Union Pathway along the Eloise Plains. The troops hoped to break through 
the Lion's Fort and make their way toward the Toroto Empire.

Before the king ordered the strike, the Braider Army temporarily set up near 
the outpost. The generals and commanders discussed tactics within a large tent. 
One can still see high level military officers milling about at all hours of the day.||||||||||Braider Military Council Tent|
44|Tent 2||||||||||||
45|Valencia Union Tunnel|In the Highlands lies the Lion's Fort, a gated outpost that belongs to the 
Valencia Union. Grim soldiers stand guard at all times.

Behind the heavy metal gate, a damp, humid tunnel twists through the 
mountains. Thorns encircle the narrow passageway, making it difficult 
(and painful) to traverse.

This tunnel connects the Eloise Plains to the Highlands. Any army that hopes 
to invade the Valencia Union must pass through the tunnel. Though the Toroto 
Empire is a force to be reckoned with, this passage makes it all but impossible
for them to take over the Valencia Union.||||||||||Tunnel used by the Valencia Union and Braider Kingdom to mobilize troops.|
46| Depths of Gowen Mountain|Through the middle of the grassy Eloise Plains twists a military pathway 
paved with marble. It feels oddly sterile to have such a manmade structure 
cutting through one of nature's virtually untouched treasures.

The Gowen Mountain Range surrounds the Eloise Plains, thus the Braider 
Kingdom has set up defensive checkpoints there. If a foe passes through the 
tunnel, they'll wind up trapped like a rat.

The Gowen Mountain Range is also dotted with naturally formed caves. 
Optimistic adventurers have attempted to visit each of the dozens of caves, 
but none have actually accomplished this goal.||||||||||Clandestine Cave|
47|Hayward Seavale Plebeian Row|The terrain spiraling from Hayward Seavale can be divided into 3 sections: 
Plebeian Row, where commoners live, Upper Crust Quarters, an area for 
higher class residents and professionals, and Nobility Realm, reserved for 
royalty and politicians.

Architecture in Plebeian Row focuses primarily on practicality. Houses are 
small, squat, and pressed together tightly. Merchants' carts fill any available 
space, leading to a lively, if cramped, atmosphere. 

Now that the residents have left Plebeian Row, it's mostly a silent, vacant 
ghost town, populated only by the occasional stray cat seeking scraps. Princess Paisha 
plans to use it as a clandestine meeting place while she seeks out the Barbarian Sorcerer's
location.||||||||||Princess Paisha's Hidden Base|
48|Hayward Seavale Nobility Realm|The terrain spiraling from Hayward Seavale can be divided into 3 sections: 
Plebeian Row, where commoners live, Upper Crust Quarters, an area for 
higher class residents and professionals, and Nobility Realm, reserved for 
royalty and politicians.

The Nobility Realm is peppered with influential politicians' mansions, each 
complete with its own garden, pavilion, fountain, and, more likely than not, 
personal circus elephant. If you don't have your own circus elephant in this area, 
you're basically nothing.

Most residents of the Upper Crust Quarters have long since fled. Prince Columbia 
uses one of the homes as a base while he searches for the Barbarian Sorcerer.||||||||||Prince Columbia's Hidden Base|
49|Braider Congress|The terrain spiraling from Hayward Seavale can be divided into 3 sections: 
Plebeian Row, where commoners live, Upper Crust Quarters, an area for 
higher class residents and professionals, and Nobility Realm, reserved for 
royalty and politicians.

Once functioning as part of Braider's governing body, congress's headquarters 
is situated high atop Hayward Seavale. Now that the castle has been evacuated, 
no one is left to govern this place, and the threat of pure anarchy and utter 
destruction looms in the air like a dark cloud.||||||||||Stately Congressional Council|
50|Kahlo Tower|The Durango Kingdom's regal insignia is splashed throughout the 
impressive Magic Palace Congressional Chamber. Murals carefully painted 
on its walls depict beautiful scenes from the Central Continent.

The lush atrium garden, which features a full view of the city's skyline, is 
magically lit at all hours by a Crystal that glows orange. This gem seems to 
radiate even more brightly in the dark.

The Durango Kingdom's congressional chamber is a domed structure made 
of clear glass. At night, light from the stars streams through, illuminating the 
room in an ethereal glow. Though the place is ragged with age, one can still 
imagine what majesty it exuded in its glory days.||||||||||Magic Palace Congressional Chamber|

was built by early immigrants to defend against attacks from outsiders. As 
Tranquil Hill developed, the threat disappeared, and the fort fell into disuse.

devoted their lives to protecting it from evil for generations.||||||||||The Twisted Base of an Ancient Tree (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
108|Malice Palace |This ancient palace has sunk almost completely into the ground and 
become enshrouded in layers of lichen and vines. It's almost impossible 
to find an entrance.

A powerful mage once lived here. It's said that his voracious studying consumed him, 
ultimately killing him. Supposedly, his ghost lingers, its endless search filling the palace with a 
desperation that drives the weak-willed to madness.||||||||||Consumed by Ambition (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
109|Rotten |The spawning ground of monstrous pests, the Rotten also poisoned the 
water in the Valley of Kings. The stench of the pollution fills the air. Plants 
have absorbed the toxic water and grown poisonous themselves, further 
endangering the local ecology.

Pustule-like eggs line the hive's entrance, held fast by gluey mucus. The pupa
feed ravenously upon hatching, leaving little for other creatures. ||||||||||A Putrid Lair of Filth (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
110|Baram's Chasm |The Avila Volcano blew a deep gorge into a towering cliff; heat and great 
power now radiate out from it. The Tuskar believe the cleft leads to the 
Flame Crystal that guards the volcano.

A river of lava flows through the cleft, between giant, gleaming crystals. The
law of the jungle presides among the fierce animals that call this place home,
and even still, only the strongest survive...||||||||||The Terrible Hollow (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
111|Baltaroi Core |Built of solid brick, the Tuskar's capital city is located so close to the 
volcano's caldera, boiling lava still sometimes bubbles up onto the streets.

Statues of valiant Tuskar warriors are displayed throughout the city, alongside
 engraved records of heroic battles. Hanging flags symbolize Tuskar unity. 
However, religious zealots have captured the city and conspire to make
 the volcano erupt.||||||||||The Occupied Capital (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
112|Mayor's Dream |This world materialized from Mayor Reginald's nightmares. Though it looks
 sweet and benign on the surface, unimaginable evil roils beneath, embodied by
 the countless monsters roaming freely.

This malicious aura is waiting for the right time to engulf everything, trapping
Reginald's soul in the dream so he'll never wake up again.||||||||||Into the Depths (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
113|Slain |Thousands of monstrous insects hide in the Arid Wilds, ready to devour 
anything. They originated from a small cave that is somehow connected 
to another dimension.

The Bane Prince opened the interdimensional door and is controlling the insects with his 
powerful magic. Thus manipulated, these monsters have embarked on a path 
of constant destruction.||||||||||The Dimensional Gate (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
114|Baira's Chamber |The ancient king who ruled the Kingdom of Amur is buried in a glorious 
mausoleum in the desert. In its treasure-filled halls, totems proclaim his 
people's love for him.

His remains were guarded for centuries, until the Bane Prince corrupted the land.
He transformed the pure souls of the Amur people into a puppet army of ghouls
and awakened the dead King, all in hopes of conquering the world.||||||||||Ancient King's Tomb (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
115|Crypticone |Bullmen gather at the mouth of Etalia Geyser, which belches forth 
sulfurous and rotten scents. Vast numbers of fanged beasts flourish 
here, and hot springs in the den maintain its scorching, humid 
temperature.

A surprisingly religious race, Bullmen believe red is a holy color, and prayerfully
hurl iron ore into hot springs for luck. When the ore turns the water red, they
celebrate it as a miracle.||||||||||The Center of Bullmen Tribe (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
116|Delphi Temple |This ancient sanctuary was the home of the Putrid Forest Pixies. As time 
passed, it sank beneath the rainforest, sealing the monsters inside. An 
Imperial Military construction project unsealed it and woke the pixies, 
who are now fighting to escape.

Scientists exploring the sanctuary's secrets have inadvertently damaged it. It's
falling apart and may have lost its primordial power.||||||||||Wandering Heart (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
117|Crooked Vein |This deep mine lies in a volcanic area. The air inside is hot and befouled 
with toxic gases. Lava boils everywhere, lighting the tunnels with a crimson 
glow.

Rainbow Ore, a rare mineral found only here, is extremely hard and shines like
 a prism. It's immensely valuable, which led the overbearing Crime Mogul Stirling
to take over the mine. He's set on making big profits from it.||||||||||Cinder and Chaff (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
118|Mara Cult Altar |Located deep in the Mara Cult's Base, this altar is a key ceremonial site. 
Bone totems forge a haunting reminder of the cult's firm belief in live 
sacrifice. Though they think animals are acceptable, they prefer human 
sacrifices.

Blackflame Peak villagers hate the cultists but are too afraid to stand up to them. The 
Mara Cult's sacred altar is the most heavily-guarded place in the entire base.||||||||||The Thrill of the Kill (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
119|Soulmor Falls |Soulmor Falls is sacred to the Bonmalmors as the last source of pure water 
in the Swamp of Decay. The cascade of spring water also creates a stunning 
waterfall.

Unusual flowers and plants grow on top of the mountain, all useful as medical
herbs and alchemy materials. They are highly valued because they are so difficult
 to get--the path to the peak is rough and crowded with monsters.||||||||||The Land of Purity (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
120|Vortek |A giant whirlpool has sprung up in the center of Gullock Swamp. Locals 
believe the swamp has been poisoned, infuriating Galt, the God of the 
Swamp, who then created the whirlpool.

People believe the vortex of the whirlpool is connected to Galt's Palace, but
that the whirlpool is blocking the path to it. A group of inventors is hoping to
use the submarine they've built to find out.||||||||||The Raging Whirlpool (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
121|Federal Armory |The Armory stands near the Lion's Fort and is the source of all weapons 
used by local soldiers. Its hexagonal walls are quite solid, and it's guarded 
by soldiers day and night.

A small fort is the only way in or out of the underground facility. All water and 
electricity systems are operated independently from above ground. The Federation also 
develops and improves weapons here.||||||||||Valencia's Arsenal (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
122|Sturmfrau |Unstable energy pulses in the air of Witchcraft Nexus. Sturmfrau, located 
in the center of the woodlands, is the heart of the energy torrent. It sits 
on a calm river, but there is something odd about its atmosphere.

Beyond the lush landscape, one might notice that the trees' bark has begun to erode. The cause
 of this erosion is unknown, but it disrupts the natural balance of the energy.||||||||||The Mother of All Storms (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
123|Skleros's Ice Abyss |This fortress stands in massive solitude, its cracked ice walls a testament 
to its difficult past.

Within the fortress lies a path to Skleros's Ice Abyss, a dazzling Cryolite underworld, 
a place long forgotten by most.  It is feared that the evil power locked within may 
one day escape and wreak havoc on our world.

124|Colossal Cauldron |This cauldron to the northeast of Witchcraft Forest provides energy 
for the entire grove. It is the cradle of all alchemy in the forest and 
houses the Witchcraft Nexus HQ.

Additionally, the cauldron stores alchemy equipment and research data.

Unfortunately, the Black Hand Gang has sinister plans to steal the secret 
to controling the forest's unique energy.||||||||||Core of Mysterious Energy (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
125|Windsnap Lair |A layer of crystalline snow covers Starfrost Forest year-round. Only the 
most violent and vicious monsters can survive here. Most dwell in 
Windsnap Lair, a cave made of ice pillars and a shimmering waterfall, 
frozen in time under a layer of slick ice.

The cave reverberates with the rumblings of storms and fierce winds. One could 
perish waiting for just a moment of silence within the lair.||||||||||Lair of the Monstrous Beast (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
127|Dark Tide Cave |Hidden within the Gowen Mountain Range is a dank cave shrouded in 
tangled branches. A great deal of vegetation grows here, creating a thick 
layer of grasses and plants that can easily hide rebel forces.

At the cave entrance stands a small camp outpost. Pass through the depths 
of the camp, and you'll find a spacious habitat. It seems comfortable enough, 
though the bleached bones scattered across the floor are a rather chilling 
decorative accent.

Deeper inside the narrow manmade passageway are walls supported by 
scaffolding. However, there's no trace of human life in the depths of this 
cavern, only the occasional guttural roar or massive footprint of a vicious beast.

176|Tower of Trials|The origins of the Tower of Trials are unknown, but it's said the tower shelters the souls of countless warriors. 
Every time a warrior perishes, his spirit 
will join with others already residing there.

As time has passed, the appearance of the tower has also changed.
Looking closely, you can see traces of destruction and rebirth. Within the tower, however, time is only a measure of change. 

The Ancient Warrior Stalis, by sheer force of will, has joined his soul to the tower itself.
While he is now part of the tower, Stalis' Trial 
is but one aspect of the Tower of Trials.||||||||||Warrior Spirit Trial Tower |
177|Shale Cavern|This ancient ruin, buried in the shifting sands, holds the secrets of a highly advanced archaic technological society.
For years, scientists have searched in vain for this legendary repository of knowledge. Now,  
due to underground tremors, cracks have formed in the walls of the ruins, providing an easy means of entry.

Within the ruins, time seems to have stood still: although their previous operator has long since gone, 
all of the instruments are still working, and continue to carry out research
according to orders given long ago. 

After comparing his own research materials with those of the Vingot Lab,
the scientist, Nikola, surmises that there is a secret buried within the ruins. In order to properly investigate,
Nikola has come fully prepared, and makes his way once more through the trap-ridden ruins. ||||||||||Unveiling the Secrets of an Ancient Civilization|
178|Malice Palace|Due to its tremendous age, the outer walls of the ancient palace are totally covered in moss and ivy.
Over centuries, much of the structure has sunk underground, hiding the entrance.
The decorative stone carvings have been heavily weathered by the passage of time.

The former resident of the palace was a great wizard, who established an ancient dynasty based on magic.
Through endless research, he attempted to discover the true nature of life.
Finally, his unquenchable curiosity spelled his own destruction. 

In order to escape the circle of incarnation, Elea, the guardian of the Branda Root, 
strove to find a way to seal Acilino permanently. The first attempts to enter this magical palace
all failed. This time, though, Elea has come bearing the Mage's Golden Scepter,
accompanied by a small band of guardians. ||||||||||Great Magician's Magic Treasury|
179|Fort Lowell|Fort Lowell rises out of the Golden Plains. Layer upon layer of solid walls surround the hill 
upon which it was built, making the idea of attacking it a forbidding prospect. 

The fort was originally renowned as a center for the arts, but lately it has come under attack by marauding groups of monsters.
As a result, all its citizens have moved into the innermost part of the fort. Lately, however, a few brave youths
have decided to take matters into their own hands.

To defend the fort against further attacks, they began to train a troupe of soldiers. 
As their strength and abilities improved, they were able not only to defend the fort against enemies, 
but also to cultivate military experts of every kind. ||||||||||An Impenetrable Fort, Rising from the Golden Plains |

182|Lost Temple|This ancient temple was previously the abode of a dragon spirit. In an earlier age,
the spirit lived here in peace with men.

But when the dragon spirit died, the temple disappeared into the Delphi Forest.
No one remembers a thing about the temple and the spirit that lived there. 

All of this should have been buried beyond the reach of memory. But many years later,
the turmoil of the world unearthed the temple, causing it to groan
melancholically.||||||||||A Myth Awakening|
183|Soul Beast's Holy Land|The Soul Beast's Holy Land, hidden beyond the border of Searing Valley, is surrounded by tall mountains,
cordoned off from the drama of the outside world, like a slice of Eden.

Now, however, the land has been invaded and occupied by a strange creature from a different world,
which is using its evil magic to infect all the other creatures. The effects can even be felt in 
Searing Valley, where the plantlife is showing signs of change.

The resulting miasma has turned herbivores into rampaging carnivores.
There will be more unknown dangers awaiting the Eternal Guardian upon his arrival.||||||||||Source of the Miasma|
184|Inner Demon Realm|The Eternal Guardians experienced many destructive battles, until their bodies produced abnormal
Dark Powers. These forces were different from the Powers of Destruction, and had great enough energy
to overwhelm the Eternal Powers.

Under the influence of these energies, a dark realm emerged from the bodies of the Eternal Guardians
The whole realm was shrouded in darkness and flames, and the air was heavy with death and curses. Slowly, the power of the Eternal
Blue Crystal began to weaken...||||||||||Depths of a Cursed Soul|
185|Samurai's Tomb|This was once the venue of the legendary Summit Battle of the three major sects: Master Fencer (Florica),
Single Blade (Loroco), and Dual Blade (Statham). These sects met
at this barren site and sparred so fiercely that the ground is still scarred from their battles.

Rumor has it that the swords of these three were forged of alloys from another world.
It is also said that they are imbued with a special energy. Many warriors have ventured here in search of these three swords.
But those who did, never returned...

The fortress used to house elite soldiers commanded by General Neondo. 
However, it fell to the Mara Cult after a cursed totem was found.

It's a critical strategic site. 

Inside the tower are hundreds of grey cells, each coldly awaiting a prisoner. 
The foul odor of urine, sweat, and hopelessness permeates the air; 
one whiff will induce vomit in even iron-stomached visitors.

Within this paradise is a secret chamber that stores ancient scriptures. While researchers

They fight one another to survive; the losers are eaten. Their pained wails echo

Beyond the entrance, you'll discover a dank underground cave. Stalactites 
hang like chandeliers from the top of the cave, while a bottomless hole, 
encircled by stalagmites, is gouged in the ground.

Because the cliff is moist, moss grows readily inside it. Thousands of bats

This island serves as a habitat for many unique creatures that cannot be found in the outside world. 
Those who dwell there have become accustomed to the odd weather and the environment. However, one cannot say the same about visitors.

According to legend, a great treasure is tucked away within this desolate island. 
Many adventurers have lost their lives searching for the grand mythical riches.||||||||||Island of Hidden Treasure |
305|Starkgem Battlefield|This plateau is home to a quiet forest with a placid lake in the center. Its 
only remarkable feature is that the algae in the water sometimes makes it 
glow in the dark.

Recently, crystals began growing around the lake, giving off an odd energy. 
Soldiers from two countries have now arrived to mine these strange crystals. 
However, both sides are determined to control trade of the crystals, and the 
once-quiet forest has become a battleground.

306|Crystal Island Battlefield|This island is warm and sun-baked all year long. Though it can get quite 
humid, residents adore its tropical feel.

After an earthquake caused by the movement of two oceanic plates, four 
crystals rose in the center of the island. Many countries coveted the energy 
pulsing inside these crystals. In the blink of an eye, the island became a battleground.

The innocent locals were forced to evacuate; their paradise became a place of bloodshed and hatred. 
Only the armies battling over the crystals remain on the island.

307|Flurry Gem Battlefield|This plain is covered with bitterly cold snow all year long; its harsh climate 
makes it a very difficult place to live. Creatures who survive here have 
developed thick pelts. Very few people reside here.

After a recent avalanche, crystals rose up from the frozen ground. Countries 
found out about these powerful gems and sent their soldiers to fight for them.

Blood now spatters the pristine snow here. Corpses litter the plain and turn icy blue.

308|Holy Battlefield: The Crucifix|Bits and pieces of this area's former magnificence can be found among 
the ruins. Delicately crafted ancient glyphs surround the entire palace, 
giving the castle a mystical feel. The crystal skylight lets in a few streams 
of milky light, though the place is mostly pitch black.
 
In the central plaza of this great palace stand countless statues, each 
portraying a human figure with his or her hands held high in the air. 
These represent the villagers' faith in a true supreme being. Although 
the history of their religion has long been forgotten, these statues reflect 
the grandiose qualities of their beliefs.

309|Deserted Island Survival|This island brims with ancient, long forgotten architecture. Strewn 
throughout the isle are supplies of unknown origins, including food, 
weaponry, and even siege weapons that still appear to be in working 
condition.

Though the island looks tranquil by day, when the sky darkens, an icy veil 
of dread sets in. Legend has it that, though the island appears empty, at 
night, visitors will hear battle cries from afar. The other residents of this 
island are not exactly friendly.

If you wish to survive in this forsaken place, you must make efficient use of 
all the resources at hand. You must also take care to avoid a section of the 
island where natural poisons fill the humid air with toxins. To escape, you 
must take out all enemies in your path. Spend too long considering your 
options, and you'll be dead before the next idyllic sunrise.|Section A|Section B|Section C|Section D|Section E|Section F|Section G|Section H|Section I|Escape the dangerous Deserted Island!|
401|Flame Eagle Arena|Flame Eagle Arena is a large square structure made of gray stone blocks.
It was once a storehouse for weaponry and equipment, but fell into disuse after the church
moved their weapons to the Federal Armory in the Highlands.

After many years, Antony, a member of the church, discovered the ruined storehouse
and suggested that it be rebuilt.
Most of the rooms were demolished, but the largest storeroom was kept to be
used as an arena. It was subsequently decorated with flags emblazoned with eagles,
giving it its new name: Flame Eagle Arena.

Antony hoped this arena would not only can be a place for glorious battles,
but would also enable contestants to interact and learn
battle techniques, creating understanding between allies and
teaching the importance of teamwork.|||||||||||
402|Monster Battle Arena|Monster Battle Arena is a bunker built in ancient times as a shelter in case 
of disaster. The local people contributed their labor to help build this 
wondrous chamber.

Now it's a center for research into wild animals and a training arena. Aven's 
Curia and the Friendship Institute collaborated to create a special beam that 
can temporarily turn anyone into a monster. Warriors can take the form of a 
monster to further their training.

Tinnech hopes that by doing so, warriors can gain a better understand of 
monsters and improve their combat skills. Moreover, Tinnech hopes to gain a 
better understand of monsters so that some day monsters and humans can 
live in harmony.|||||||||||
403|Warrior's Sanctuary|After Curia interpreted and analyzed the documents regarding Central 
Continent's ancient civilization, they discovered a ruin in the desert basin.

Antonio, with the Curia's permission, turned this ruin into a 1 vs. 1 arena. 
However, as the area is an important (and somewhat fragile) historical 
landmark, it is not yet open to the public.

Antonio hopes that this arena will help warriors improve their skills and 
learn the importance of teamwork.|||||||||||
404|Demon Inferno Arena|In an abandoned prison, the spirits of tortured criminals wander around 
and refuse to leave. The resentments and hatreds from them have gathered 
into a burning giant ghost.

Being explored by adventurers accidentally, this mysterious prison had the 
chance to be exposed to the public again. The adventurers found the giant 
flame ghost; that's how it got its name.

After Curia evaluated its risk, they decided to close it. Only warriors approved 
by Kimoso can train there.|||||||||||

406|Temple Arena|The ancient architecture defies any rational logic, and
a wild array of scenes are carved into the stone of the monument. Most surprising is that these ancient ruins
have never been owned or managed by human hands...
Instead, they are entirely operated by strange and mystical machinery.

According to legend, coming-of-age rites were once carried out here by an ancient clan.
These rites entailed various challenges, including fighting summoned creatures. One fateful day, however, they summoned a demon so powerful, it wiped the entire clan out.
While they could not escape their tragic fate, they were
able to seal their enemy inside this temple.

Despite being isolated, the powerful demon continued to emit a violent aura.
This dark force overtook all who came seeking knowledge or treasure, filling them with bloodlust
and ensuring this holy temple was in a constant state of violent chaos.|||||||||| A Game of Treasures|

The story takes place a long time ago in a faraway kingdom. After
 the king passed away, an overly ambitious queen took over 
the formerly peaceful, serene nation. To ensure that she reigned 
supreme, she took extreme measures to garner the support of 
neighboring countries. She even betrothed Princess Nica, 
a beauty beyond compare, to a nearby nation's prince 
in the hopes of solidifying her power.

The Duke's son, Robin, and the princess were childhood friends.

dirt are veins of mineral ore. Generations of villagers have made livings off these 
valuable materials. Over time, methods of extracting the ore have become quite advanced.

However, now that the Bane Encampment has invaded, the villagers here have put down 
their shovels and picked up their weapons to defend their town. With the help of the 
Eternal Guardian, perhaps they can succeed against the odds. This area is merely an illusion, 
meant for training, but to the naked eye, it looks incredibly real.||||||||||Bane Encampment's Invasion|

only drawn the interest of the Tomb Raiding Gang, a skilled group of thieves.

These robbers attacked mercilessly, leaving the Graveyard Guards injured and 
frustrated. They have asked for the Eternal Guardian's assistance, hoping to stop

rioting prisoners killed most prison guards.||||||||||One Mad Winter's Night (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
807|Basel Border |Toroto Kingdom has begun a full-scale attack on Valencia Union.
The Union soldiers fought bravely, but were forced to retreat to the castle on
the border. Villages nearby were reduced to ruins.

Bodies littered the ground beneath clouds of ash. Though Valencia's troops still
guard the fort, their food supply wanes. It's only a matter of time before
they surrender or are defeated.||||||||||Frontline of the War (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
808|Sturmfrau |Unstable energy pulses in the air of Witchcraft Nexus. Sturmfrau, located 
in the center of the woodlands, is the heart of the energy torrent. It sits 
on a calm river, but there is something odd about its atmosphere.

Beyond the lush landscape, one might notice that the trees' bark has begun 
to erode. The cause of this erosion is unknown, but it disrupts the natural 
balance of the energy.||||||||||Tempest's Origin (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
809|Skleros's Ice Abyss |This fortress stands in massive solitude, its cracked ice walls a testament 
to its difficult past.

Within the fortress lies a path to Skleros's Ice Abyss, a dazzling Cryolite 
underworld, a place long forgotten by most.  It is feared that the evil power locked 
within may one day escape and wreak havoc on our world.

810|Colossal Cauldron |This cauldron to the northeast of Witchcraft Forest provides energy for the 
entire grove. It is the cradle of all alchemy in the forest and houses the 
Witchcraft Nexus HQ.

Additionally, the cauldron stores alchemy equipment and research data.

Unfortunately, the Black Hand Gang has sinister plans to steal the secret to
 controling the forest's unique energy.||||||||||Core of Mysterious Energy (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
811|Windsnap Lair |A layer of snow covers Starfrost Forest year-round. Only the most violent 
and vicious monsters can survive here. Most dwell in Windsnap Lair, a cave 
made of ice pillars and a shimmering waterfall, frozen in time under a layer 
of slick ice.

The cave reverberates with the rumblings of storms and fierce winds. One could perish 
waiting for just a moment of silence within the lair.||||||||||Lair of the Monstrous Beast (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
812|Gristle Prison |Toroto recently took over this area; it was once Valencia's prison but now 
houses an ex-prisoner who works for Toroto.

Toroto set up a lab in the deepest chamber of the castle and developed 
a weapon of mass destruction there. This weapon could spell disaster for 
nearby residents and Valencia troops. 

Toroto captured an individual, locked him away in the chamber, and plans to experiment upon him.

813|Guillotine |This is the sacred location of the Drakai who live in the Death Valley; 
they perform holy ceremonies here. 

This area is also used to punish criminals; thus, it's known as Guillotine.

After evil spirit invaded this area, any lingering holy power faded out. In 
its place are evil spirits and monsters. They use Statues of Destruction to 
disrupt the sacred site's holy atmosphere. 
|||||||||| Holy Court (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
814|Rage Cape |You can find this hidden road near Tempest Cliff. Each layer is more 
dangerous than the last.

This road is difficult to locate, and most of the vegetation in the 
area is withered and dead; thus, no one takes much of an interest in living nearby.

However, because of its location, the road is the perfect place to 
station soldiers to defend from outside attacks.
||||||||||Vigilant Stronghold (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
815|Century Abyss |Once an important Toroto fortress, this abyss was destroyed and 
became a lair for outworld monsters. 

Warriors eventually slayed all the monsters, but no one dared go 
into the dark, broken Century Abyss again.

Evil has begun to spread through the abyss once more. Demons lurk 
around every corner. Perhaps this is a sign of the end of the world.||||||||||Demon Ritual Fortress (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
816|Vilespire Temple |In the middle of the Devastation Realm sits the Vilespire Temple. It used 
to be quite majestic, but now it's merely a shell of its former self. The columns 
on both sides of the front gate are encircled by monstrous, vibrant vines that 
seem eager to ensnarl any unsuspecting visitor.

While the ruins are decrept, it's clear that the temple was once glorious and lively. 
Sadly, only a pile of dust and debris remain.

While this area is almost completely destroyed and abandoned, it still strikes fear 
into the hearts of any passersby.
||||||||||Ancient Temple (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
817|Rose Temple |The Chief Minister of Toroto dwells in the luxurious Rose Temple. 

Precious, gleaming gems dot the walls, glossy furs are strewn throughout the rooms, and riches pile up in every corner. 
In fact, locals say there are more treasures within these walls than there are books in the Curia Library. 
Countless thieves have attempted to steal these opulent possessions, but the temple is heavily patrolled, 
and most of these would-be burglars wind up in prison.

Rumor has it that the Chief Minister has a secret chamber in the innermost depths of this sprawling temple. 
No one knows whether this is actually true.
||||||||||Chief Minister's Residence (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
818|Uncharted Cave |This is truly a hidden paradise in the Searing Valley. Giant, winding vines 
form a pathway to a beautiful cave studded with gem-like stalactites. Sunlight 
reflects off its surface, giving it an eerily arctic glow. It is truly a slight to behold.

Within this paradise is a secret chamber that stores ancient scriptures. While researchers know that 
these scriptures contain evil truths, the ancient language is very difficult to understand. 

Behind a tall, gilded door is a starkly empty room painted pure white. Painfully bright lights 
pour into the space, creating an oddly oppressive feel. 

||||||||||Uninhabited Region (Single Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 1-3 players)|
819|Meteor Crater <Single Player>|When a huge meteor struck the earth, the ground gave way, creating a 
huge crater littered with rock fragments. The ground is scorched; it's still 
hot to the touch. In the middle of the crater is a narrow, precarious hole 
beckoning you inside.

Beyond the entrance, you'll discover a dank underground cave. Stalactites 
hang like chandeliers from the top of the cave, while a bottomless hole, 
encircled by stalagmites, is gouged in the ground.

Because the cliff is moist, moss grows readily inside it. Thousands of bats 
make their home in the Stalactite Concavity. The Skyway Waterfall provides 
the cave's only sunlight and is strewn with beasts' bones.||||||||||Underground Cavernous Grotto (Single Player DGN) (Only 1 player may enter)|
820|Dark Tide Cave <Single Player>|Hidden within the Gowen Mountain Range is a dank cave shrouded in 
tangled branches. A great deal of vegetation grows here, creating a thick 
layer of grasses and plants that can easily hide rebel forces.

At the cave entrance stands a small camp outpost. Pass through the depths 
of the camp, and you'll find a spacious habitat. It seems comfortable enough, 
though the bleached bones scattered across the floor are a rather chilling 
decorative accent.

Deeper inside the narrow manmade passageway are walls supported by 
scaffolding. However, there's no trace of human life in the depths of this 
cavern, only the occasional guttural roar or massive footprint of a vicious beast.

821|Kahlo Tower <Single Player>|The Durango Kingdom's regal insignia is splashed throughout the impressive 
Magic Palace Congressional Chamber. Murals carefully painted on its walls 
depict beautiful scenes from the Central Continent.

The lush atrium garden, which features a full view of the city's skyline, is 
magically lit at all hours by a crystal that glows orange. This gem seems to 
radiate even more brightly in the dark.

The Durango Kingdom's congressional chamber is a domed structure made 
of clear glass. At night, light from the stars streams through, illuminating the 
room in an ethereal glow. Though the place is ragged with age, one can still 
imagine what majesty it exuded in its glory days.||||||||||Kahlo Tower (Single Player DGN) (Only 1 player may enter)|

in the mist. This towering, awe-inspiring architectural work, strung with 
decorative crystals that glow at twilight, will make your jaw drop.

Legend has it the Driftglow Sanctuary contains a secret power that allows 
the Durango Kingdom to float effortlessly in the air. The magic crystal 
implanted in the structure glows with an indescribable energy.

However, the Bane Prince's forces have infiltrated Iyernafalo and have 
gained control over its guards. No one is sure what will happen to this

901|Boss Monster Challenge <Party>|Glittering Eden Crystals, most found beneath Aven, support the day-to-day

Unfortunately, the magic energy of the Eden Crystals also attracts vicious 
monsters. These beasts travel through dimensions and tunnel underneath 
Aven in an attempt to seize the crystals and absorb their power.

The monsters, infused with the strength of the gems, have become much 
more powerful and dangerous. Aven has decided to ask the Eternal Guardians 
for help dealing with this issue.||||||||||Boss Monster Challenge <Event Mode DGN> (For 3P-5P)|
902|The Eternal Crystal's Power <Party>|The Demon Inferno Arena was once an abandoned jail. A group of 
adventurers discovered it, and Aven converted it into a training arena.

However, random monsters constantly attack the warriors at the arena. 
An investigation conducted by Aven Curia determined that the monsters 
are actually Boss monsters from other dungeons.

Apparently, the Boss monsters, furious that the Eternal Guardians have 
beaten them so many times, banded together to take over the Demon 
Inferno Arena. They want to challenge the Eternal Guardians once again!||||||||||The Battle to Guard the Eternal Crystal <Event Mode DGN> (For 3P-5P)|

In an attempt to stop this scheme, the Soul Guardian entered the altar to 
find the children. The Soul Guardian was able to use magic to hide the

244|Crypticone <Party> <Rating>|Bullmen gather at the mouth of Etalia Geyser, which belches forth 
sulfurous and rotten scents. Vast numbers of fanged beasts flourish here, 
and hot springs in the den maintain its scorching, humid temperature.

A surprisingly religious race, Bullmen believe red is a holy color, and prayerfully
hurl iron ore into hot springs for luck. When the ore turns the water red, they
celebrate it as a miracle.||||||||||The Center of Bullmen Tribe (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
245|Delphi Temple <Party> <Rating>|This ancient sanctuary was the home of the Putrid Forest Pixies. As time 
passed, it sank beneath the rainforest, sealing the monsters inside. An 
Imperial Military construction project unsealed it and woke the pixies, who 
are now fighting to escape.

Scientists exploring the sanctuary's secrets have inadvertently damaged it. It's
falling apart and may have lost its primordial power.||||||||||Wandering Heart (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
246|Crimson Fort <Party> <Rating>|The fort was built under the supervision of the Bloodtooth Tribe's proud 
leader, Ken. It's mostly used as a prison for slaves. The giant tooth at the 
entrance serves as the tribe's emblem.

The scent of rancid blood and festering death consumes the fort, the thick odor entangled 
with slaves' pained screams. Ogresnever tire of wars, so they do their best
 to wreak havoc in Delphi Forest.||||||||||Invaders' Outpost (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
247|Crooked Vein <Party> <Rating>|This deep mine lies in a volcanic area. The air inside is hot and befouled 
with toxic gases. Lava boils everywhere, lighting the tunnels with a crimson glow.

Rainbow Ore, a rare mineral found only here, is extremely hard and shines like
 a prism. It's immensely valuable, which led the overbearing Crime Mogul Stirling
to take over the mine. He's set on making big profits from it.||||||||||Cinder and Chaff (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
248|Mara Cult Altar <Party> <Rating>|Located deep in the Mara Cult's Base, this altar is a key ceremonial site. 
Bone totems forge a haunting reminder of the cult's firm belief in live 
sacrifice. Though they think animals are acceptable, they prefer human 
sacrifices.

Blackflame Peak villagers hate the cultists but are too afraid to stand up to
them. The Mara Cult's sacred altar is the most heavily-guarded place in the
entire base.||||||||||The Thrill of the Kill (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
249|Century <Party> <Rating>|This stronghold stands atop Blackflame Peak in the Toroto Kingdom. The 
fortress used to house elite soldiers commanded by General Neondo. 
However, it fell to the Mara Cult after a cursed totem was found.

Today, zombies are created within the walls of the fortress. The soulless soldiers attack 
anyone who comes near, making it impossible to investigate the strange and mystical
 goings-on inside.||||||||||Stronghold of Sorrow (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
250|Soulmor Falls <Party> <Rating>|Soulmor Falls is sacred to the Bonmalmors as the last source of pure water 
in the Swamp of Decay. The cascade of spring water also creates a stunning
waterfall.

Unusual flowers and plants grow on top of the mountain, all useful as medical
herbs and alchemy materials. They are highly valued because they are so difficult
 to get--the path to the peak is rough and crowded with monsters.||||||||||The Land of Purity (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
251|Vortek <Party> <Rating>|A giant whirlpool has sprung up in the center of Gullock Swamp. Locals 
believe the swamp has been poisoned, infuriating Galt, the God of the 
Swamp, who then created the whirlpool.

People believe the vortex of the whirlpool is connected to Galt's Palace, but
that the whirlpool is blocking the path to it. A group of inventors is hoping to
use the submarine they've built to find out.||||||||||The Raging Whirlpool (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 2-3 players)|
252|Federal Armory <Party> <Rating>|The Armory stands near the Lion's Fort and is the source of all weapons 
used by local soldiers. Its hexagonal walls are quite solid, and it's guarded 
by soldiers day and night.

A small fort is the only way in or out of the underground facility. All water
and electricity systems are operated independently from above ground. The
Federation also develops and improves weapons here.||||||||||Valencia's Arsenal (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
253|Basel Border <Party> <Rating>|Toroto Kingdom has begun a full-scale attack on Valencia Union.
The Union soldiers fought bravely, but were forced to retreat to the castle on
the border. Villages nearby were reduced to ruins.

Bodies littered the ground beneath clouds of ash. Though Valencia's troops still
guard the fort, their food supply wanes. It's only a matter of time before
they surrender or are defeated.||||||||||Frontline of the War (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
254|Manor <Party> <Rating>|Located under the Lion's Fort, the Manor is the prison of Highlands.
Valencia keeps prisoners of war and vicious criminals locked away within its
 walls. To stymie escapes, its halls are labyrinthine.

Although no prisoner has ever escaped, during the invasion of Toroto Kingdom,
rioting prisoners killed most prison guards.||||||||||One Mad Winter's Night (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
255|Colossal Cauldron <Party> <Rating>|This cauldron to the northeast of Witchcraft Forest provides energy for the 
entire grove. It is the cradle of all alchemy in the forest and houses the 
Witchcraft Nexus HQ.

Additionally, the cauldron stores alchemy equipment and research data.

Unfortunately, the Black Hand Gang has sinister plans to steal the secret to
 controling the forest's unique energy.||||||||||Core of Mysterious Energy (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
256|Sturmfrau <Party> <Rating>|Unstable energy pulses in the air of Witchcraft Nexus. Sturmfrau, located 
in the center of the woodlands, is the heart of the energy torrent. It sits 
on a calm river, but there is something odd about its atmosphere.

Beyond the lush landscape, one might notice that the trees' bark has begun 
to erode. The cause of this erosion is unknown, but it disrupts the natural 
balance of the energy.||||||||||The Mother of All Storms (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
257|Windsnap Lair <Party> <Rating>|A layer of snow covers Starfrost Forest year-round. Only the most violent 
and vicious monsters can survive here. Most dwell in Windsnap Lair, a cave 
made of ice pillars and a shimmering waterfall, frozen in time under a layer 
of slick ice.

The cave reverberates with the rumblings of storms and fierce winds. One could perish 
waiting for just a moment of silence within the lair.||||||||||Lair of the Monstrous Beast (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
258|Skleros's Ice Abyss <Party> <Rating>|This fortress stands in massive solitude, its cracked ice walls a testament 
to its difficult past.

Within the fortress lies a path to Skleros's Ice Abyss, a dazzling Cryolite 
underworld, a place long forgotten by most.  It is feared that the evil power locked 
within may one day escape and wreak havoc on our world.

259|Guillotine <Party> <Rating>|This is the sacred location of the Drakai who live in the Death Valley; 
they perform holy ceremonies here. 

This area is also used to punish criminals; thus, it's known as Guillotine.

After evil spirit invaded this area, any lingering holy power faded out. In 
its place are evil spirits and monsters. They use Statues of Destruction to 
disrupt the sacred site's holy atmosphere.

260|Gristle Prison <Party> <Rating>|Toroto recently took over this area; it was once Valencia's prison but now 
houses an ex-prisoner who works for Toroto.

Toroto set up a lab in the deepest chamber of the castle and developed 
a weapon of mass destruction there. This weapon could spell disaster for 
nearby residents and Valencia troops. 

Toroto captured an individual, locked him away in the chamber, and plans to experiment upon him.
||||||||||Deranged Inmate Lab (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
261|Rage Cape <Party> <Rating>|You can find this hidden road near Tempest Cliff. Each layer is more 
dangerous than the last.

This road is difficult to locate, and most of the vegetation in the 
area is withered and dead; thus, no one takes much of an interest in living nearby.

However, because of its location, the road is the perfect place to 
station soldiers to defend from outside attacks.
||||||||||Vigilant Stronghold (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
262|Century Abyss <Party> <Rating>|Once an important Toroto fortress, this abyss was destroyed and 
became a lair for outworld monsters. 

Warriors eventually slayed all the monsters, but no one dared go 
into the dark, broken Century Abyss again.

Evil has begun to spread through the abyss once more. Demons lurk 
around every corner. Perhaps this is a sign of the end of the world.||||||||||Demon Ritual Fortress (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
263|Uncharted Cave <Party> <Rating>|This is truly a hidden paradise in the Searing Valley. Giant, winding vines 
form a pathway to a beautiful cave studded with gem-like stalactites. Sunlight 
reflects off its surface, giving it an eerily arctic glow. It is truly a slight to behold.

Within this paradise is a secret chamber that stores ancient scriptures. While researchers know that 
these scriptures contain evil truths, the ancient language is very difficult to understand. 

Behind a tall, gilded door is a starkly empty room painted pure white. Painfully bright lights 
pour into the space, creating an oddly oppressive feel. 

||||||||||Uninhabited Region (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
264|Rose Temple <Party> <Rating>|The Chief Minister of Toroto dwells in the luxurious Rose Temple. 

Precious, gleaming gems dot the walls, glossy furs are strewn throughout the rooms, and riches pile up in every corner. 
In fact, locals say there are more treasures within these walls than there are books in the Curia Library. 
Countless thieves have attempted to steal these opulent possessions, but the temple is heavily patrolled, 
and most of these would-be burglars wind up in prison.

Rumor has it that the Chief Minister has a secret chamber in the innermost depths of this sprawling temple. 
No one knows whether this is actually true.

265|  Vilespire Temple <Party> <Rating>|In the middle of the Devastation Realm sits the Vilespire Temple. It used 
to be quite majestic, but now it's merely a shell of its former self. The columns 
on both sides of the front gate are encircled by monstrous, vibrant vines that 
seem eager to ensnarl any unsuspecting visitor.

While the ruins are decrept, it's clear that the temple was once glorious and lively. 
Sadly, only a pile of dust and debris remain.

While this area is almost completely destroyed and abandoned, it still strikes fear 
into the hearts of any passersby.
||||||||||Ancient Temple (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
266|Meteor Crater <Party> <Rating>|When a huge meteor struck the earth, the ground gave way, creating a 
huge crater littered with rock fragments. The ground is scorched; it's still 
hot to the touch. In the middle of the crater is a narrow, precarious hole 
beckoning you inside.

Beyond the entrance, you'll discover a dank underground cave. Stalactites 
hang like chandeliers from the top of the cave, while a bottomless hole, 
encircled by stalagmites, is gouged in the ground.

Because the cliff is moist, moss grows readily inside it. Thousands of bats 
make their home in the Stalactite Concavity. The Skyway Waterfall provides 
the cave's only sunlight and is strewn with beasts' bones.||||||||||Underground Cavernous Grotto (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
267|Dark Tide Cave <Party> <Rating>|Hidden within the Gowen Mountain Range is a dank cave shrouded in 
tangled branches. A great deal of vegetation grows here, creating a thick 
layer of grasses and plants that can easily hide rebel forces.

At the cave entrance stands a small camp outpost. Pass through the depths 
of the camp, and you'll find a spacious habitat. It seems comfortable enough, 
though the bleached bones scattered across the floor are a rather chilling 
decorative accent.

Deeper inside the narrow manmade passageway are walls supported by 
scaffolding. However, there's no trace of human life in the depths of this 
cavern, only the occasional guttural roar or massive footprint of a vicious beast.

268|Kahlo Tower <Party> <Rating>|The Durango Kingdom's regal insignia is splashed throughout the impressive 
Magic Palace Congressional Chamber. Murals carefully painted on its walls 
depict beautiful scenes from the Central Continent.

The lush atrium garden, which features a full view of the city's skyline, is 
magically lit at all hours by a crystal that glows orange. This gem seems to 
radiate even more brightly in the dark.

The Durango Kingdom's congressional chamber is a domed structure made 
of clear glass. At night, light from the stars streams through, illuminating the 
room in an ethereal glow. Though the place is ragged with age, one can still 
imagine what majesty it exuded in its glory days.||||||||||Durango Kingdom Palace (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
269|Iyernafalo <Party> <Rating>|High above the clouds, the Driftglow Sanctuary known as Iyernafalo hovers 
in the mist. This towering, awe-inspiring architectural work, strung with 
decorative crystals that glow at twilight, will make your jaw drop.

Legend has it the Driftglow Sanctuary contains a secret power that allows 
the Durango Kingdom to float effortlessly in the air. The magic crystal 
implanted in the structure glows with an indescribable energy.

However, the Bane Prince's forces have infiltrated Iyernafalo and have 
gained control over its guards. No one is sure what will happen to this 
majestic sanctuary.||||||||||Regal Empyreanos (Multi-Player DGN) (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|

The Orphid Tribe, who rely on the tree to live, hold a sacred ritual of prayer beneath the tree every sixty years
to express their gratitude and give praise to the almighty tree.

The Tree of Life responded to the tribe's prayers of thanksgiving by
opening unto them a mysterious, twisting passageway leading to its very depths.
This place became known as the Camodor Chastelands.

Through mutual understanding and cooperation,
the Orphid Tribe flourished under the guidance of the tree,
and all knew happiness.||||||||||Life's Steadfast Resolve <Multi-Player DGN> (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|
271|Rheutear Temple <Party> <Rating>|The Rheutear Temple is a mystical sanctuary located at the center of an equally mysterious lake: even in the coldest of temperatures, the lake's waters never freeze. Those near the lake
believe its powers to be a blessing bestowed by the River God,
and they use its waters to irrigate and nourish the land.

Settlers built the Rheutear Temple at the center of the lake to express their gratitude to the River God
for providing them with the waters
they needed to live and thrive under nature's grace.

Constructed from solid rock, statues of gods adorn the vast halls of the temple, and endless water flows down every side.
The temple itself is a testament to the respect and reverence
the locals have for the River God.||||||||||Waters of the Highlands <Multi-Player DGN> (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|

where they could study and research gravity, propulsion, and relativity at the base of the city's Northern Watchtower.
Even now, they continue to operate it in secret.

Crumbling masonry, scatterings of dusty books and papers, and a dilapidated entrance
cleverly give the impression that the lab has long been abandoned, but concealed deep within these ruins is a fully-operational
research facility where all manner of abhorrent experiments are underway...

As if this camouflage was not enough, scientists within the lab have imposed strict regulations
to prevent their research from being divulged to the public, and those who mistakenly enter its forbidden halls
are never seen again...||||||||||The Concealed Truth <Multi-Player DGN> (Recommended for parties of 3-5 players)|

merely serve to help conceal the darkness within its walls.
Few are aware of the top-secret plans being hatched right beneath their noses.

A deep elevator shaft within the tower leads to an underground research facility
where the government carries out classified projects and controversial experiments in secret.
Use of the elevator is strictly controlled, and only the highest-ranking officials have access.

Guards patrol the facility's halls like hounds, determined to keep any of the confidential research within from being leaked,
for these experiments are testing cruel, inhumane weapons that could wipe out all of mankind...

649|Hero Trial - Uncharted Cave|This secret cave, hidden within the cliff walls of Searing Valley, is an untouched paradise. Set high on the mountain, the cave receives dazzling sunlight,
while remaining shielded from prying eyes.
Giant vines create a winding pathway to the beautiful stalactite caves.

Deep within the Occultus, most of the walls of the great library have already collapsed,
and the ancient handwritten manuscripts are covered in the dust of eons. Barely-comprehendible symbols hint at
a long-suppressed evil force.

After Vingot Lab was taken over by a rebel army, the king of Toroto planned a siege to retake the complex.
The rebel army received word of this invasion, and assembled on Uncharted Cave,
hoping to defeat the army by ambushing it on both sides. They would then be free to continue their research.
At the same time, another group of researchers were investigating the murder of the Temple Knights...||||||||||A Careful Ambush (5-Player DGN) |

the local residents have gotten used to seeing rare and strange items.
This has subsequently broadened their understanding of the world.

Even so, eyes seem to watch trespassers from the shadows.

The research room, protected by a powerful force field, harbors all sorts of strange,
horrifying scientific equipment, while indecipherable code scrolls down a large screen.
Above, a huge generator still hums, providing the laboratory with all of its energy needs. This fully automated
laboratory is conducting grotesque, terrifying research.

A wandering adventurer stumbled across it, bringing it back into the light of day.
Since then, it's been used as a training arena for Aven's citizens.

Recently, however, warriors training in the arena have suffered strange attacks by unknown monsters. 
Investigations have revealed that the attacks are being
instigated by crazed dungeon leaders -

leaders that are being controlled by an unknown power.

Pure spring water flows from Batelo Valley to every corner of the jungle,
and many animals thrive in its lush vegetation.

Countless trees in the northeastern forest have been felled by the armies of Toroto and
the Valencia Union. These armies have also cleared underbrush
and built sprawling encampments in their stead.

They live there in harmony with wildlife and nature. Since ancient times, the tribe has seldom
been in contact with the outside world, and it adheres to rigorous tribal laws and customs.

The land west of the basin is more mountainous, and
it contains breathtaking waterfalls, formed over millennia. Its water
flows down to the lakes in the southeast, including the enchantingly-hued Opal Lake.

Located in the southeast corner, Allolans is the highest part of Shaxia Basin.
Its most well known feature is the temple there where the Shaxia tribespeople offer sacrifices to their gods and ancestors. In Shaxia culture, the right to settle
around the temple is given according to social class, with aristocracy living at higher altitude near the temple, while lower-class families reside in the lower regions.|Plebeian Row|Training Grounds|Opal Lake|Palatine Court|Farmland|Allolans (DGN)||||An isolated tribe resides in this remote area.|

vibrant, it's skies clear and vast.

The Korrin Fort stands tall and strong, so those who have arrived are safe behind it's walls while 
they venture out into this once unknown land. It's also a place of commune and commerce for those 
of the elven race and those who have now come to the land.

To the north lies a winding track through greenery, before arriving at a sparkling beach that seems 
to call out to those who near its waters. While to the south lies a vale of magic and mist, seeped

biographies, histories, popular novels, and much more. Even if someone were to read

186|Sanguine Sanctuary|Legends speak of a bloodstained battlefield deep within the Eyebloom Plain.
Grand Medium Lily was lead here by the Lost Soul to seek out and destroy an aura of evil,
but upon using her third eye to cut through space and time, something else slipped through
the cracks. Something wreaking of depravity and sin...

Now, nothing grows on these plains but squalor and dashed hopes.
Tangled ruins and ravaged corpses of fallen warriors lie strewn across char and soot.
The air reeks of gunpowder and blood, so much blood, yet the breeze is eerily silent,

and the grasses do not stir. The battle is already over, and the dead are all that remain.
Gone, gone is the thumping of drums. Gone, gone is the clanging of swords.
All is silent.
All is dark.||||||||||The Sanguine Sanctuary keeps its dead.|
187|Quagmire Skein|Long have these ruins of old lain untouched by humanity. Hidden away in the depths of untamed wetlands,
their entrance is guarded by a myriad of trapsXand even more countless bodiesXnow a warning to would-be explorers across the land.

A pair of Veteran Explorers discovered the ruins by chance, but they lacked the skills
to safely navigate the snarl of puzzles and pitfalls.

What could be hidden within the depths of these ruins is a mysteryXand an obsessionXto many,
but it seems only the truest adventurers will ever know what lies beyond its depths...

Foul beasts, as well, find themselves drawn to the pulsating energy of the valley.
As its fluttering tendrils have increased in fervor, so too has the rampant discord wreaking havoc amongst this once-calm valley, and
the wizards residing there have been forced to relocate to conduct their traditional rituals.||||||||||What secrets remain hidden in this mysterious valley's depths?|

764|Assault on Helios City [Party]|The port city of Helios resides on a small island just off the Central Continent
Its location makes it a prime stopover point for trade ships, and the nearby cliffs
protect it from wind, storm, and the occasional invading force. Life couldn't be better for many of its down-to-earth residents.

Peaceful as it may seem, however, its low profile has also made it an attractive hideaway for many an underhanded entity.
The Western Alliance has enacted a hidden base under guise of a civilian harbor association.
Here, they've been biding their time, amassing a stockpile of military weapons away from the prying

eyes of the Central Alliance.
Word has spread, however, that they've caught the attention of the Trolevares, and tensions are on the rise...

The Orphid Tribe, who rely on the tree to live, hold a sacred ritual of prayer beneath the tree every sixty years

The Tree of Life responded to the tribe's prayers of thanksgiving by
opening unto them a mysterious, twisting passageway leading to its very depths.

of the camp, and you'll find a spacious habitat. It seems comfortable enough, 
though the bleached bones scattered across the floor are a rather chilling 
decorative accent.

Deeper inside the narrow manmade passageway are walls supported by 
scaffolding. However, there's no trace of human life in the depths of this 
cavern, only the occasional guttural roar or massive footprint of a vicious beast.
