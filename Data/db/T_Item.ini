20757|Mist Boots|$7$"If the stories are to be believed, these boots are capable of walking on fog as if it were a solid surface. Testing this has proven quite difficult and, in several instances, fatal."|
20758|Rose Knight Helmet|$7$"This helmet, with its intricate designs, is gifted to those who have performed great services for the Rose Knights. The Rose Knights themselves do not use them, as they are too fragile for battle." |

21975|Calmbloom|Can be found on farms.

$7$"When this bloom opens, it releases a light lavender scent into the air; anyone nearby will find themselves suddenly calm. Even bloodthirsty beasts have been known to settle down and start crocheting when they get a whiff of this flower."|

21991|Purple Beast Bone|Can be found in mines.

$7$"After a giant beast dies, it leaves behind this aubergine bone. It's unknown if the purple bone strengthens the beast or if the beast's strength turns the bone lilac. It's a chicken or the egg scenario, just with purple bones."|

23363|Isolda's Icy Clutches|$7$"The chill from Isolda can penetrate your gloves and freeze your hands. When she closes her fist tightly, you can hear the sound of ice shattering."|
23364|Ultimate Beast's Scale Helm|$7$"This helm is made from the Ultimate Beast's facial skin. The horns on the helm are from the beast, too. The wearer will feel rage rushing through his or her blood."|

23367|Corken's Veil|$7$"This veil, one of Corken's prized possessions, absorbed her dark power and became magical. Oh, and it also covered up her weird-looking face. If someone else wears the veil, their lips will be pulled into a crooked, strange smile."|

23370|Blade's Broken Sword|$7$"This blade fell from Blade's sword. It causes Blade to want to slaughter anything and everything in its path. Whoever owns this piece must focus on controling the weapon and defeating enemies; don't let the rage take over your mind, or all will be lost."|
23371|Isolda's Frozen Heart|$7$"Isolda's cruelness chills her enemies to the core. Every prisoner that has escaped from her is traumatized for life; they call her the Queen of Ice."|
23372|Ultimate Beast's Broken Core|$7$"After many experiments and failures, the strongest Ultimate Beast ever was created. However, in the end, the mutant creature, like all mortal beings, died. It left behind its artificial heart to remind its maker not to tamper with nature."|
23373|Marquis Saad's Dragon Taming Rules|$7$"The ancient dragons are arrogant, to say the least. They eat anyone who dares challenge their authority. Some people turned their attention to the Turiasauruses and succeeded in taming several of them. Their tricks are recorded in this book."|
23374|Maul's Atrophied Body|$7$"After Maul the artificial bug died, it emitted a terrible odor - somewhere between a skunk and a wet dog - and shrank several sizes. What remains of its body is extremely hard and regenerates. Ew."|
23375|Corken's Whisper|$7$"During battles, Corken whispers to the enemies she kills, hoping she can reach their souls."|
23376|Kequa's Hell Key|$7$"Kequa uses this key to open the door to purgatory. Desperation washes over prisoners when they see it, as they know it means they will never return to their lives or loved ones."|
23377|Kimba's Sinister Ruby|$7$"Kimba's body is inlaid with numerous shards of broken rubies. All the fragments shimmer with a sinister light; they symbolize his evil intentions. He wants to destroy the world, and darn if he's not going to look sparkly and fabulous while he does it."|

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
24908|Sorkin's Wirefur Belt|$7$"Made from Sorkin's barbed fur, this belt contains numerous hooks and pockets. Priests attach potions and scrolls upon it. They can even tuck in their ID and credit card when they go dancing, though there is not enough room for a cell phone."

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
24916|Eye Abyss's Emblem Hat|$7$"Eckle's hat features a proud emblem.  They say that advanced technology woven into the very fabric of the hat can somehow monitor and read data. The implications of this sort of computer-hat hybrid are unknown, but it looks pretty cool." 

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
24917|Taipan's Rock Ring|$7$"This dingy ring is believed to be the origin of Taipan's powers. If someone with insufficient willpower dons this bauble, they will eventually lose touch with their humanity."|
24918|Stonmo's Jitters|$7$"This item is festooned with tiny, gleaming crystals from Stonmo's body. The energized wearer will refuse to rest, even for a moment. It's quite a dangerous item, though if you're a fan of quadruple espressos, you might not notice a difference."|
24919|Luala's Fiendglow Ring|$7$"Luala made some alterations to this ring. If you rub it three times, you will enter into a clandestine contract with her, becoming a slave to the ring."|
24920|Arrons's Healing Artifact|$7$"The source of Arrons's self-healing is this ancient, crumbling artifact that must be powered by incredibly strong magic. It's quite old, and most of its inherent magic has faded or been drained."|
24921|Dascha Adwim's Runic Necklace|$7$"This necklace, made with 3 large onyx runes, is quite the statement piece and would look simply stunning with an evening gown. Oh, and it's imprinted with gilded text that informs the wearer that he or she won't be sucked into the vortex when the space-time rift opens."|
24922|Seven's Quicken Magic|$7$"This incredibly powerful, quick-witted magic can block any and all attacks and respond accordingly. Because of this power, Seven has been bestowed the title 'Palace's Fastest Mechanical Soldier' a record 15 consecutive times."|
24923|Yagi's Flashing Diodes|$7$"A total of 8 flashbulbs can convey a number of system messages, from 'all systems go' to 'commence attack' to 'the cookies are out of the oven.' That last one is my favorite."|
24924|Michelano's Exasperation Ring|$7$"Due to his status and skill, Michelano applied to be a member of the royal elite guards. However, after his mother fell ill, he chose a mission within the palace, where he could make the most money to help with her medical expenses. He misses combat and occasionally detests the mundane and foolish requests of his charges. He tries not to complain, preferring to glance at his heirloom ring and simply sigh about the asinine lives of royalty." |
24925|Eckle's Gilded Eyeball|$7$"The irises in Eckle's golden eyeball spin wildly, as though trying to convey something. Since eyes can't talk, though, it's likely a mystery that will never be solved."|
24926|Rheafer's Petrified Crystal|$7$"Tiny drops of violet crystal dot Rheafer's forehead, gleaming in the moonlight. They say that perhaps his powers were once concentrated within these gems."|
24927|Dascha Adwim's Mystifying Grimoire|$7$"Bound in blood-stained dragon hide, the Bane Prince's grimoire seems to contain some sort of record. However, the contents are disorganized, confusing, and often written in scrawling gibberish, making it all but impossible to decode the book's true purpose."|

27188|Reaper's Mercy|$7$"Any soldier worth his salt has a concealed dagger with him
$7$when going into combat. When the battle turns and your chances of survival look bleak, it's comforting to know that you
$7$have an alternative to death at the end of an enemy's lance."|
27189|Hyduc's Rapier|$7$"In Hyduc's tribe, only those of high status may carry a
$7$rapier such as this one. Though expertly crafted, its magnificent blade is decidedly more decorative than functional."|
27190|Aqua Vitae Blade|$7$"Using the stream emanating from the Tree of Life to quench freshly-forged swords makes them
$7$shine with a ghostly white hue at night."|
27191|Fountainhead Mace|$7$"This mace draws its magic from gemstones found in natural
$7$springs. These crystals are polished over countless years by the tumbling spring water, thereby acquiring some of the
$7$water's magical power."|
27192|Freefall Fist|$7$"Depending on the wielder's proficiency in combat, this weapon can be used to chop, stab or
$7$bludgeon. With enough strength and skill behind it,
$7$there is no armor in the world that can resist its attack.
$7$"|
27193|Frostphantom Club|$7$"Once used to obliterate boulders in the frozen north, this club has been imbued
$7$with a frigid spirit which can never be thawed."|
27194|Rhutean Katana|$7$"An ancient blade discovered by the first adventurer to explore the Rheutear Temple.
$7$Legend has it that plunging the sword into water will cause even the most violent waves to
$7$instantly subside."|
27195|Winter's Somnia|$7$"This greatsword emits a chilling blast when it strikes, evoking visions of winter in the minds
$7$of those made cold by the fall of its blade
$7$|
27196|Baal's Battleaxe|$7$"This monstrously heavy weapon, once lifted, has the power to cleave anything
$7$it touches upon its violent return to earth."|
27197|Anti-Gavel|$7$"This weapon went missing from the Quantum Physics Institute after one of their many anti-gravity experiments.
$7$Though the hammer may look cumbersome, the technology utilized in its construction allows just about
$7$anyone to wield it. The other consequence of this feature is that the damage it deals is also
$7$reduced."|
27198|Magnetron Bow|$7$"A new type of weapon developed by the Quantum Physics Institute. It uses electromagnetic assistance to
$7$ensure that even weaker users can pull it to full-draw. However, it doesn't help much
$7$if you're aim isn't up to snuff in the first place."|
27199|Thunderclap Cannon|$7$"The most devastating of magical cannons. Due to its
$7$concentrated magical power, the concussion wave it produces when fired
$7$can damage your hearing for life if you're not wearing earplugs.
$7$"|
27200|Rock of Aegis|$7$"The tuning on this instrument is always a little tricky to dial in, but if you use it to play rock

$7$prowess."|

$7$after work had been completed, some of the decommissioned parts were used in the construction of this
$7$spear."|
27204|Gravity Screen|$7$"This shield uses electromagnetism and totems to protect its user.
$7$The person who designed it seems to have overlooked the fact that it will not do much to deter animal attacks."|
27205|Primeval Cloak|$7$"An ancient cape that is equally suited for use in
$7$harsh environments as it is for sophisticated engagements."|
27206|Vineswing Cape|$7$"The high-quality craftsmanship and affordability of this garment make it
an effective and reliable product that many travelers swear by."|
27207|Enigma Cloak|$7$"The residents of the Mystical Forest use native materials and knowledge
$7$to hand-embroider every inch of this cloak."|
27208|Hyduc's Cape|$7$"This cape is especially handy for people who want to spend extended periods in the wild. It has a
$7$unique scent which drives away mosquitoes."|
27209|Boulder Plate|$7$"This defensive gear hails from the Boulder area. Its massive size means it can't be worn
$7$by most normal people, but it does offer unbeatable protection."|
27210|Heroic Chainmail|$7$"Legend has it that long ago, a famous general was exiled in this place.
$7$As penance for the crimes he committed in his homeland, he shared his knowledge of armor forging with
$7$the locals. This armor is the result of those secret techniques."|
27211|Jahrran Linens|$7$"This cloth armor is specially designed for the inhabitants of the Jahrra Camp. Even though
$7$it has a very steep price tag, the lack of alternatives means that there is no other
$7$option for the people of Jahrra but to buy it."|
27212|Efflorescent Robes|$7$"This ceremonial robe is worn by the priest during the ritual offering of nectar
$7$during the annual Forest Festival. Its adornments of status and renown are a
$7$source of protection."|
27213|Girderheft Belt|$7$"This belt is made from the finest steel and has been expertly tempered. The word 'heft'
$7$in its name is really just a reference to the hefty amount of work that went into its creation; it won't weigh you down too much."|
27214|Icefield Crystal Belt|$7$"This belt is made with translucent gemstones unearthed in the Ice Fields. Even though they've been removed from their frozen source,
$7$they give off a slight chill which can be felt by the belt's wearer. Old fishwives claim the cold is a good way to suppress your appetite."|
27215|Glacial Wafer Belt|$7$"This belt was forged from the finest metal available and quenched in the icy waters of an ancient glacier. The item derives its name from the fact that it's
$7$so thin that light can pass right through it."|
27216|Fireproof Belt|$7$"This belt is crafted from a specially tempered cloth. If you throw it in the fire, it
$7$will simply be cleansed rather than being consumed by the flames."|
27217|Golden Alloy Boots|$7$"This piece of armor was forged in the famous volcanic furnace in Blazeburg.
$7$It consists of a special alloy which is both lightweight and durable, making it suitable for any environment."|
27218|Flamecrawl Boots|$7$"These boots are meticulously crafted from the hides of hundreds of volcanic mice.
$7$It may seem like a strange source for the leather, but it's worth it: you can walk over the hottest surfaces without feeling a thing
$7$|
27219|Downy Boots|$7$"To counter the extreme climate of the Iceflame Highlands, the people here
$7$all have at least two pairs of insulated boots. This down-filled footwear allows you
$7$to walk in deep snow without so much as feeling a chill."|
27220|Lightning Sprint Boots|$7$"If the residents of Blazeburg ever need to get somewhere in a hurry, these are the boots
$7$they reach for. Although they offer less protection than some other footwear, they make their wearer's steps
$7$extremely light and agile."|
27221|Magnetron Gauntlets|$7$"During the casting process, mysterious lines are engraved in these gauntlets and inlaid with other metals.
$7$This process imbues the gloves with defensive magic."|
27222|Silent Skin Gauntlets|$7$"These gloves are made from exceptionally rare magic-proof leather. They can
$7$withstand magical attacks, but they also prevent their wearer from casting spells."|
27223|Adaptive Steel Gloves|$7$"Made from the most malleable metal around, these gloves are so flexible
$7$that they don't impede their user's movements in the slightest."|
27224|Wireskin Gloves|$7$"Durable metal is drawn out into filament wires before being woven
$7$into these silk-like gloves. Their only drawback is that they are not terribly resistant
$7$to extreme temperatures."|
27225|Power Core Ring|$7$"Graylin is full of energy-driven devices;
$7$to avoid causing too heavy a drain on the power grid, everyone wears
$7$small personal reactors such as this one."|
27226|Kinetica Ring|$7$"People naturally swing their arms when they walk, so this ring
$7$stores the resulting kinetic energy to be used as a back-up when needed. This highly creative and reliable solution is a testament to
$7$Alcheim's tradition of innovation."|
27227|Ornate Ring|$7$"This ring is made of a delicate combination of carved rock and machined steel. You can add special
$7$adornments to make it even more beautiful."|
27228|Blossom Ring|$7$"This exquisite ring is made of woven wild plants by naturalistic people
$7$who eschew alchemy."|
27229|Meeryasha Helmet|$7$"This is the standard-issue helmet for the guards in Alcheim.
$7$It's simple and practical."|
27230|Militiaman's Helmet|$7$"Graylin has not seen the flames of war for a great many years; their standing army was dissolved in favor of keeping the peace with
$7$the help of a militia. The leather headgear they wear is a symbol of
$7$their profession."|
27231|Skepsis Crown|$7$"This crown was fashioned by those who reject the intrusion of alchemy into their lives.
$7$It is decorated with numerous flower-shaped glyphs."|
27232|Inspector's Crown|$7$"Worn by the most intimidating of Inspectors, this crown features a sleepless, all-seeing eye
$7$which can peer into the hearts of men."|
27233|Kerus' Nocturnal Dagger|$7$"Normally brandished by Kerus, this dagger has been specially forged
$7$so that it will not reflect any light at all, making it ideal
$7$eerily in the moonlight."

27234|Frisaya's Thorn|$7$"This rapier is modeled after the one wielded by the Ethereal Lord, Frisaya.
$7$The manufacturer says that it will fly through the air and attack enemies on its own, but that seems like a pretty dubious
$7$claim."|
27235|Sinash's Tailbone|$7$"Sinash's tailbone is thick at the base and tapered at the end, which makes it look surprisingly like
$7$a one-handed sword. Due to the exceptionally high density of the bone, it looks like it would make for quite an
$7$unwieldy weapon."


$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
27236|Gailett's Edge|$7$"A one-handed sword made from fragments of Gailett.
$7$Because they are so hard when cooled, there is no way to forge the weapon
$7$unless suitable, semi-molten fragments are collected immediately after battle."|
27237|Forsinol's Energy Core|$7$"This alchemical item was created by merging the attributes of various creatures;
$7$because of the constituent monsters' impressive combined strength,
$7$the resulting energy core is extremely valuable."

$7$warrior as powerful as Katus."

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
27240|Frisaya's Wing|$7$"This unusual katana is crafted by filing down Frisaya's wings. As these were
$7$the Ethereal Lord's primary means of propulsion, the sword is exceptionally dense."|
27241|Krontius' Greatsword|$7$"This sword is formed purely from Krontius' power. While it drains
$7$your power during use, it also increases your Fencing speed."

27242|Geroy's Axe|$7$"Geroy's nocturnal hunting habits require special equipment. This axe is one of his favorite tools, on account of its

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
27243|Lendar's Sledge|$7$"Lendar's tail is covered in razor-sharp barbs and spikes, so even though

$7$inflict serious lacerations."

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
27244|Tamotan's Grasp|$7$"This weapon was a side project of the Heavy Matter Experiment, and was created using Tamotan's
$7$left hand. Seeing as the left arm is slightly bigger than the right, you surmise that
$7$its designer was a lefty, as well."

27247|Gailett's Heartstrings|$7$"Even though researchers have verified the hypothesis that artificial machines do not have souls,

$7$expired."|

27252|Forsinol's Dusk Shroud|$7$"Armor once used by Forsinol. Despite its ethereal appearance,

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
27253|Lino's Frost Armor|$7$"Lino's frost is perfectly capable of resisting bladed weapons, but it is

$7$armor."

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
27254|Kerus' Fleeting Brigandine|$7$"This is Kerus' preferred means of protection. Because its previous owner had a habit of

27260|Frisaya's Hoard Mail|$7$"The biggest weakness of all dragonlike creatures is the their soft underbellies. To

$12$Disassemble in the Arcane Box to obtain Crystal Cross Medals.|
27269|Lino's Frostheave Helmet|$7$"The permafrost harvested from ice monsters will not melt for a thousand years; it also provides

27274|Wanda's Pearlescent Necklace|$7$"Mermaids spend their long lives living in the sea, so the precious pearls that humans like to wear as adornments
$7$are about as valuable as rocks in their eyes. The necklace that Wanda
$7$wore is indeed made of small pearls, but they were used exclusively for their magical properties."|
27275|Katus' Cannibal Ring|$7$"Once worn by Katus, this ring is rumored to make any kind of meat
$7$smell irresistibly tempting. However, the ring's colossal size means that most normal people are
$7$unable to wear it."|

27278|LAB-TR-000's Suction Pad|$7$"A suction pad taken from the body of an alchemical creature. The failed experiment
