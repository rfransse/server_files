64798|Judgment Blade (1-Hand)|$7$"The weapon is truly worthy of its title. Those who fall under its blade have little hope of escaping alive."|
5935|Kepgoyle's Cursed Belt|$7$Trendy and stylish, why wouldn't you take it. Not like a corpse needs it right. Granted it's quite heavy and seems to be cursed... but that's just a minor detail.|
5936|Fraize's Blight Ring|$7$This blight inflicted little piece of jewelry sat upon Fraize's finger. It's gem seems to swirl with icy evil in an almost entrancing way. Perhaps don't stare at it for too long.|
5937|Diamcrys' Frosty Favour|$7$As a thank you gift for pulling her out of the blight induced insanity, the beautiful deity Diamcrys gave you a glass sphere. Within some of her magic shimmers with snowflakes and dances with snowy wonder. It's truly breathtaking to look upon, like the deity herself.|
5938|Shivva's Icy Wing|$7$Long and quite pretty, this wing is cold under your fingers, almost shimmers like snowflakes and yet crackles like shifting ice. Would make a great icepack right? Perfect.|
5939|Fraize's Top Hat|$7$The top hat feels almost cold to the touch. But that won't stop you from wearing it. Who looks dapper now? You? Damn right you do.|
5940|Kobra Cing Poisoned Scales|$7$No longer are these once pristine shiny scales shown off by the proud reptile. Now they molt faster and show how tainted the serpent has become.|
5941|Sluaw's Wicked Eye|$7$Ever watchful, this eye that was once in Sluaws skull, seems to still watch everything going on around it. That feeling you're being watched... it's justified.|
5942|Floickle's Blighted Flower|$7$The once beautiful blooming flower atop Floickles head would bring peace and joy to those who journeyed to see it. Now it is closed and corrupted, driving the placid creatures mad.|
5943|Smarok's Broken Core|$7$What was considered the heart of the giant rock monster, is now nothing more than cumbled pebbles. Yet still they seem to feel as though they almost hum with power.|
5944|Goroc's Torn Bandages|$7$Bandages used by miners to keep the helpful golem they made together, now lie in tatters. Stained with blight, they no longer keep the maddened monster together.|
5945|Zarloe's Blight Soul|$7$After defeating the wicked commander all that's left is his glowing soul. It seems to drip evil and hum with wickedness. Touching it seems like a bad idea now. Hindsight, am I right?|
5946|Drilbott's Hacked Circuitboard|$7$The once helpful machine, used to drill through hard rock to get the most precious crystals went haywire without warning. It's circuit looks tampered with and is obviously the reason why.|
5947|Saplins Wilting Vines|$7$No longer the beautiful long viney tendrils that once adorned Saplin, these vines are listless and starting to shrivel. The blight causing it is clear, but it's too late to cure poor Saplin.|
5948|Bladbeaks Sharp Beak|$7$Razor sharp and with a lethal point, Bladbeak knows how to use his most deadliest weapon. The crazy creature wasn't able to be cured so there was no choice but to take it... and hang it on the wall as a trophy... Yes, no choice.|
5949|Ferriks Dismembered Leg|$7$Ha! What's it going to do without it's leg? Teach it for losing its mind and attacking. Now you have it's leg as a trophy! A creepy still moving trophy. Ok maybe this wasn't entirely thought through.|
5950|Wisvyras Impure Jewel|$7$Sitting in the middle of her forehead Wisvyra displays her sparkling jewel. Filled with power, she protects it fiercely. But now its sparkle has dulled and whatever has affected it has sent poor Wisvyra crazy. Touching it probably wasn't the greatest idea after all. Heh hindsight.|
5951|Machors Broken Horn|$7$Part of what makes Machor look so formidable and majestic is his large horns, protruding from either side of his head. Pity you went and broke one then isn't it.|
5952|Yanishas Evil Amulet|$7$Even centuries after her death, Yanishas amulet still pulses with such intense evil power. Perhaps this is why she was so easily bought back.|
5953|Crysalis' Mask|$7$This thick heavy mask hid the face of the blight queens general Crysalis. The rest of her looked so amazing it seemed like a good idea to remove it. What was beneath was just terrifying. Bet you wished you hadn't removed it now.|
5954|Mucklies Messy Puddle|$7$What once was a creature made of mud, crystal, twigs and magical energy is now nothing more than a blob of sticky substance. I wouldn't eat it if I was you.|
5955|Draglings Dismembered Tailbone|$7$What? It's not like he needed it anymore. And it's cleaned off. It's a trophy now... Stop Judging!|
5956|Skrims Sinister Hood|$7$This thing radiates with the dangerous blight, it's almost oozing out of it. Picking it up may not have been the best idea, so definitely don't wear it.|
5957|Gloriosas Gift|$7$As a thank you for ridding her of the blight that tried to take her over, Gloriosa has presented you with a pile of magical shimmering dust. It forms into a flower whenever you hold it in your palm. Now you'll never forget your great deed.|
5958|Illustios Offering|$7$This magnificent ring shimmers brilliantly with magic. A gift from Illustrio as a thank you for bringing him back out of the blight madness.

5959|Serpagons Frozen Tear|$7$The grief at the loss of his partner is so great that Serpagon stays by her remains forever more. His loyalty and love for her still shining in his tears, frozen by the cold bitter weather surrounding them.|
5960|Treglar's Poisoned Soul|$7$The once peaceful soul of the grove keeper has been poisoned by the blight infecting the land and it's people, it's creatures. It has turned the once placid Treglar into a mindless rage fueled menace.|
5961|Feabelles Toxic Faedust|$7$The shimmer and magic of such an enchanted creature as Faebelle isn't just an illusion, it's her magical faedust. This is like her very essence, she can't live without it. But the once shimmer faedust is now full and seems to radiate with something sinister.|

6008|Partial: Badge of Crime|$7$Despite being the best criminal, he left his badge behind on the ground. Now the question that prevails is: Was it on purpose? Is he coming back for you? Were the cops looking and he wanted to make you look bad?|
6009|Partial: Badge of Punishment|$7$May not be the FBI but this cop is good. Too good. So good that it's almost impossible that Crime always escapes him. Is it on purpose? Are they playing hide and seek? When will Punishment let the torture begin?|

6017|Partial: Beryl's Broken Bow|$7$This broken bow may very well be why Beryl started to feel pain. You won't possibly reduce any damage if your weapon is not in good shape, right? And well... She's not fooling anyone with her screaming so... Keep poking!|
