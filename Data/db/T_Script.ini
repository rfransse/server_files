101|Lime Rock Mountain|Section 1: Awakening|In the mine pit of Andrew's Mine, you unexpectedly found you sleeping in the blue crystal, which surprised everyone.
 
When you wake up, although you are in a warm and lovely mining village, you can't remember anything except your name. Knowing the people around you may be able to find clues while understanding the current situation. |You easily defeated the intractable poisonous mushroom in the mouth of the villagers, and there seems to be power moving in your body. The head of mine Brad suggests that you go back to the pit where you were born and find a sample of the blue crystal.

But in the mine, there is a demon waiting for you. Although you are struggling to defeat him, your life experience is even more misty. |
102|Lime Rock Mountain|Section 2: The Clue of the Crystal|Domi thinks that the previous demon appeared to assassinate you, which made him worry for you. He snapped a snapshot and gave the blue crystal fragments to the merchant Yali. Perhaps the clues can be found by his gem identification skills.

But this hamster merchant seems to be unable to identify the blue crystal immediately...|Ali's identification tool was taken away by the man, but you can find his tool among the many cows.

The identification work will begin immediately, but the more detailed the instrument identification, the longer it will take. When you helped deliver the report by the way, you also learned that the old southern mine was in serious trouble. |
103|Lime Rock Mountain|Section 3: The Magician by the Waterwheel|The appraisal result of the blue crystal is released, but the composition is no different from ordinary crystal. Fortunately, Alex tells you that although the scientific appraisal is ordinary, this crystal may have magical aura that cannot be detected by the instrument.

Only Melia, the magician at the waterwheel hut, can give you the answer. But she looked like a very cold woman. |Ask the magician to help you identify the crystal and let you run around. In the end, it turns out that you are the one that Miria has been waiting for for a long time. From her, you heard a key word-Son of Eternity.

The son of God, born from the blue crystal, came to the world to build a legendary paradise. But although Chinos had heard the legend of the Son of Eternity in his hometown, if he wanted to know more detailed clues, he might have to go to the big city and ask other people. |
104|Lime Rock Mountain|Section 4: Southern Old Mine|Southern old mine is said to have been occupied by the Toxic Mushroom King and the Giant Stone Puppet. This is the main cause of the Toxic Mushroom raging on the Lily Rock Mountain.

The mine was messed up. Although Chinos stopped the mine, he could not do anything about the monsters in it. Before asking for external help, he entrusted you to go inside to collect information. |You defeated the huge monsters in the old mines in the south and ended the trouble of the limestone mountains. Everyone felt weird about this matter and extremely happy, and now I can be more sure that you are not an ordinary person.

It's time to embark on a journey and slowly find the moment of memory and mission. Let's set off for Seagull Town in Tranquil Hill! |
105|The Hill of Tranquility|Section 1: The Dilemma of Seagull Town|Just stepping into Seagull Town, the Sunshine Guard Bliss introduced here endlessly. Unexpectedly, the seemingly prosperous town has a lot of problems waiting to be solved recently.

Try to help the Security Bureau complete the task of sweeping jellyfish or patrolling. The more people you know, the more things you might know. | Sheriff Job introduced by Bliss seems to be indifferent to you. Even if the routine tasks of the Garrison Bureau are dealt with or even extra help is given, it seems that they cannot immediately get to the core of the problem.

It wasn't until I met the mayor Aristotle that I realized that you seemed to have been helping the police station with official duties, and the sheriff didn't know what he was doing. |
106|Tranquil Hill|Section 2: Eagle Bandit Group|It turns out that the biggest trouble in Seagull Town is the arrogant bandit-Eagle Bandit Group. But the Garrison, which is almost irrelevant, can't help at all.

Truman, a businessman who suffered heavy losses, thought that there were thief in Seagull Town, and he decided to hire you to investigate the entire incident. Let's start by capturing the robber's secret letter...|After contacting the robber, the most important clue is the secret letter written by the inner thief. But the truth is often surprising. I asked the foreman who worked at the pier and related people in the town, and the sealed letter turned out to be written by Sheriff Job!

Before finding any more powerful evidence, Truman hoped that he would not be surprised. So you continue to deal with the robber and retrieve the antique sword of his friend Broto. |
107|The Hill of Tranquility|The third quarter: Eagle Bunker|The former knight Broto, decided to re-hold the sword in order to defeat the Eagle Group. But this requires your help to weaken the power of the robbers.

You marched in two ways, and Broto led the robbers away. Your first goal was to destroy the eagle bunker, the stronghold of the robbers. |You go straight to the eagle bunker, even the head of the eagle group Gaitaki can't match you. The Eagle Group collapsed in your attack and became history.

But more interesting is the pocket watch of the Black Hawk Battalion Commander, which was a gift from Sheriff Jaber. With conclusive evidence, he seemed to be unable to escape. The town of Seagull has finally restored its former tranquility, and you have received heartfelt thanks from the mayor and the townsfolk. |
108|Colorful Waterfall Forest|Section 1: The relationship between Yeming and Colorful Waterfall|Yeming Village in the Colorful Waterfall Forest is a small village dominated by frogs. They seem to depend on this forest, coexist and prosper with it.

I have known many frogmen, but it seems that a certain kind of worry is spreading in everyone's hearts. Gradually you find that their common troubles come from the Hei Ad Group. |The village is confronting the black ad group. The admired Babas took in Qiu An a few years ago, and that is the current leader of the black ad. At that time, after he stole important secrets of the village, he led the black ad group into the Caibao Forest.

In order to avoid the leakage of information, you defeated the enemy scouts lurking around the village. At least in this way, the enemy would not be able to grasp the movement of Yeming Village. |
109|Colorful Waterfall Forest|Section 2: Guardianship by Rainbow Lake|There is a commotion near Rainbow Lake, and the whole forest is full of restlessness. If you want to know the situation, you have to ask people who often haunt Rainbow Lake.

The wizard Zumter mentioned the vision of the forest, which may be related to the abnormal energy of the rainbow gem. Although it is not sure what it means, is it possible that a gem with energy is similar to the blue crystal you have born? |A few explorers were found in the forest. They were at a loss when they were attacked by black ads, so you might help them. The main reason for the creatures near Rainbow Lake to become irritable is that the Black Ad Group tried to command the tortoise and beast army to attack Yeming Village.

But before this news is implemented, you have found out Black Ad's trainer Klonny, so that he can no longer do anything wrong. |
110|Colorful Waterfall Forest|Section 3: Fight against Black Ador|From the mouth of the frog girl, I slowly understand the mission of Yeming Village to guard the waterfall forest. The crystal column passed down from generation to generation in the Anlian family may be related to the legendary rainbow gem that maintains the operation of the forest.

At this moment, there was a commotion in the Heigar camp. This may be a good time to attack. Instead of the previously injured Shiva, go to the camp to find out...|The commotion of the Heigar came from the gray tongue trying to break away from the Heigar group. After you helped him defeat Lieutenant Hei Ad to gain trust, you learned of Qiu An's true conspiracy.

Using the excavated crystal pillar slot, he learned the hiding place of the colored ruby. As long as the energy of the colored ruby ??is obtained, no one can defeat Qiu An again. For this reason, Gray Tongue escaped from the black ad camp and gave the slot to you to return it to Yeming Village. |
111|Colorful Waterfall Forest|Section 4: Ancient Waterway|The crystal column slot dug out by Qiu An's stealing information from Yeming Village, and An Lian's heirloom crystal column can be combined to obtain a key to guide the exact location of the rainbow gem.

Babas went alone to the ancient waterway where the gem was hidden to prepare to deal with Qiu An. An Lian, who is worried about him, entrusts you to enter the waterway together and help Babas fight. |Bababas was ambushed and wounded, and the Hongguang Key was snatched by Qiu An. All hope now rests on you.

You shuttled through the ancient waterways and ended Qiu An's ambitions. Although the key lost its power and turned back into a crystal pillar, the rainbow gem finally recovered its energy. Rainbow gems are not related to blue crystals, but you saved the waterfall forest with your extraordinary ability and will. |
112|Gold Mountain Domain|Section 1: Getting to Know the Mountain Domain|The head of God Mountain in the Gold Mountain Domain is a young chinchilla family. A while ago, an ancient screw cap was found in a deep well in the village, which convinced everyone that there are ancient civilization relics buried under the ground and started exploration.

However, the exploration trip encountered a bottleneck due to the surrounding beasts, and many people were even injured as a result. But in addition, the busy guard team in the village was also troubled by certain things. |Repulsed the leopards around the village, and helped God Village raise the raw materials for the guards' armor. You quickly gained the trust of the villagers.

Vein scientist Xia La is studying the stones on the Gold Stone Monster. She is sure that there are ancient civilization magnetic remnants on it, but this has to be handed over to the weird scientist Addison, waiting for his data analysis to be completed. |
113|Gold Mountain Domain|Section 2: Clues to the Lost Civilization|In order to study the core of the ex-girlfriend Xia La's confession, Addison needs your help to collect materials in order to transform the core analyzer with better performance.

This is the only clue about the remains of the ancient civilization. He seems very excited. This is simply the effort of a fanatical scientist in pursuit of the truth. |It costs you a lot of hard work to find the transformation materials. Not only do you have to recapture the merchant's goods from the beasts, but you also have to collect the lack of lubricant raw materials. With your help, the data analysis is finally completed, and Addison hopes to get back together with Xia La.

The good news was reported to Xia La and Peel, but Xia La was sad because Addison was still obsessed with work as before. |
114|Gold Mountain Domain|Section 3: Collapsed Stone Pit|Peel used to compare with Addison, but after hearing that Addison had gone to the collapsed stone pit to study the remains, Peel couldn't help worrying about his safety.

Although he entrusted you to go to the stone pit to protect Addison's safety, he always felt that Peel ambivalently hoped that something would happen to Addison. |Entering the collapsed stone pit only saw many ancient and huge ancient civilization robots. After you defeated these guys who attacked you, you see that the excited Addison has completed the robot manufacturing through the ancient civilization driving formula.

Showing off his robot to Peel, he angered Peel. He blamed Xia La for everything and decided to fight Addison again, and the struggle between the two began in full swing. |
115|Gold Mountain Domain|Section 4: Fighting the Gold Coins and the Legend of the Dragon|The other major problem facing the Gold Village is the gold coin group gathered by tomb robbers, who are preparing to seize the treasure in a mysterious location. Such a move made the villagers extremely frightened, as if it would evoke the terrible nightmare of God Village.

In order to help his brother, who is the captain of the guard, build a weapon capable of fighting against the gold coin group, Xiong Ren Baixi asked you to help. |Help Baixi build sharp weapons and solid armor, which moved Fitz very much. Under investigation, it turned out that the gold coin group wanted to find the treasure guarded by the sleeping dragon, which might awaken the dragon and make God Village fall into catastrophe again.

Fitz seems to be planning to go out in person, and you helped him knock down the lieutenant of the gold coin group dispatched by the forward beast den. |
116|Gold Mountain Domain|Section 5: Bone Cave|Fitz just ran to the Bone Cave, intending to knock down all the members of the gold coin group in one fell swoop. Before that, he asked you to tell the monster hunter Ivanster, this guy has fought against the dragon before, and Fitz needs his help.

However, everything is not as simple as Fitz imagined...|Ivanster was worried that the blood fighting in the cave of beast bones would awaken the dragon, and such worries have come true. The battle between Fitz and you and the gold coin group brought the sleeping dragon back to life.

After Fizz fled back to the village in a hurry, you fought this evil dragon, and there was only a small figure jumping around in the huge cave. Finally, the dragon fell, and it could no longer harm the world. You have become the savior of God Village. |
117|Lengfeng Bay|Section 1: Harbor Affairs|Beluga Bay is an extremely prosperous trading port, but it is attacked by pirates, making it increasingly difficult for many businessmen to do business here.

But what worries the architect Chebman is not the pirate attack, but the high wall of the harbor he designed for defense, being corroded by jellyfish mucus. If these troubles are resolved, maybe we can know what else happened. |Cleared jellyfish, and also helped traders solve the problem of robbed goods. During this process, you also saw the wreckage of Webber's ship destroyed by pirates. It seems that the pirates are really the source of trouble here.

But until you get rid of the nearby fierce eagle leader who called the eagle group to attack the town, your ability is fully affirmed. You may be the talent the mayor Boruman has been looking for. |
118|Cold Wind Bay|Section 2: Daughter and Pirate Man|The sad expression of the village chief does not seem to be just for the offending pirate.

The town's guard Caroline told you a story about a girl who rescued a man who was in a coma by the sea, and the two fell in love. If you tell Boruman this story, you may know more insider. |It turns out that Boruman's daughter fell in love with the man who the robber pretended to be. She was abducted and drank the poison and became unconscious. The man turned into an orc and fled. You helped track down the whereabouts of the orcs and saw footprints in front of the cave deep in the Skeleton Jungle.

The defensive team will be dispatched to investigate. Before that, they introduced you to work for the noblewoman Barbara, who is working hard to capture Boruman's heart. |
119|Cold Wind Bay|Section 3: Skeleton Lair|In addition to tracing Edwin's whereabouts, the garrison also discovered that the tribal imps in the Skull Lair were provoked by pirates and are preparing to assemble and attack Beluga Harbor!

They must not be allowed to succeed. Because the garrison team is focusing on dealing with pirates and your previous outstanding performance, the garrison captain Cecil decided to assign you to go deep into the Skeleton Lair, and maybe you can find Edwin's whereabouts. |Dive into the Lair of Skeletons and you defeated these tribal imps and their leaders. Find Edwin who turned into an orc, and kill him to take back the blueprint of the city wall. Boruman's mood didn't improve, he decided to hide Edwin's death from his daughter, but Sarah must wake up first.

But at this time, Chebman discovered that the design of the city wall actually had traces of rubbings. Perhaps the copy had fallen into the hands of the pirates! |
120|Cold Wind Bay|Section Four: Fighting Pirates|Your excellent ability makes Cecil willing to give you more important tasks. He asks you to go to the base camp of the evil shark pirates and meet with his garrison, Ham Nathan. Undercover Ivy meets.

But at first you can't get their trust. In such a dangerous place, ordinary guards are not useful. You have to try to prove that you are a good investigator. |You show excellent reconnaissance ability, which makes Hamilton and Ivy willing to share intelligence and tactics with you. Taking advantage of the moment when the evil shark cadres are meeting, you will destroy their gunpowder system in a while, and then smash the various pirate squads.

In the end, you defeated Gorba and regained the replica of the wall design of Beluga Harbor, solving the most urgent crisis in Beluga Harbor. Then wait for the moment to wipe out the evil shark in one fell swoop. |
121|Cold Wind Bay|Section 5: Evil Shark Base Camp|The alert Hamaton burned the small note in his hand. Judging from the excited expression on his face, the Beluga Harbor garrison's plan to counter the pirates has finally arrived. This last step is a battle plan jointly participated by all the townspeople.

On the other hand, Ivy, the pirate sent by the garrison, was shocked to hear that the identity of the spy had been found out, but the other party did not make the matter public. |Unexpectedly, lurking in the pirate room of the pirate base campSpy is Edwin who was knocked down by you in the Skull Cavern. Now he changed his evil spirits to the right. Although he saw through Ivy's identity, he took the initiative to contact Ivy and share information.

The plan of the garrison to hit the west has successfully led the elite pirates out of the base camp. Taking advantage of this opportunity, you and several brave men launched a raid on the pirate base camp and successfully defeated the three cadres of the evil shark pirates.

However, the war between harbor townspeople and pirates will only truly come to an end when the pirate leader Roger falls. |
122|Ancient Wetland|Section 1: Fun Facts of the Expedition Team|The places where catastrophes occur are often the most attractive to explorers. It is rumored that the magic city that disappeared due to the big explosion is hidden in this ancient wetland.

The expedition stationed here not only couldn't find a way to enter the magic city, but the team members also fell ill and left the team due to the influence of mushrooms releasing poison gas. Explorers are trying to find a way to detoxify. |With your assistance, the accompanying researchers set out to make detoxification drugs. The tedious analysis work is crucial to whether the expedition can continue.

But in the minds of the expedition funders, the serious lag in the exploration progress is what worries him the most. The expedition camp was filled with frustration, and at this moment you brought back a huge magical rhizome, which slightly boosted the morale of the expedition team. |
123|Ancient Wetland|Section 2: The Mystery of Magical Water Source|With your help, Meranda's research has made breakthrough discoveries, and has a better understanding of the water quality in the wetland.

Melanda believes that all problems may come from the source of the current. The source of the current is near the giant trees in the south, and perhaps an unexpected discovery can be found at the source. |Under the guidance of Melanda, you come to the root of Brand, a big tree located in the south. Loren, the guardian of Brand Root, learned that this tree also relies on the fountain of magic to grow.

After intensive investigation, the source of evil magic turned out to be the ancient demon Azsat. After a fierce battle, you finally got rid of the devil. When everything is over, Loren will deliver to you the rune representing the guardian of Brand's Root. |
124|Ancient Wetland|Section 3: Brand's Root|Since the ancient demon died in your hands, the commotion of the wetland creatures seems to have not subsided. But the branches and leaves on the big tree Brand began to wither, all of which were completely contrary to what everyone expected.

To understand the reasons for all of this, you may have to talk to the guardian of Brand's Roots, and maybe someone will be able to find out the main reason for the withering of the tree. |From Loren's mouth, I learned that the demon you killed before was just a ghost, and the real demon had already escaped into the roots of Brand.

The threatened demon fully absorbed the energy of Brand's Root. You know that even the greatest magician is not its opponent. You can only get into Brand's Roots to get rid of the demons while the demons have not fully recovered their power. |
125|Ancient Wetland|Section 4: The Lost Palace Clues|The pharmacist Feynman who accidentally met tells you that what is permeating in the northwest is not poisonous gas, but magic particles left over from the big bang.

The plants exposed to magical particles have become quite rare. Perhaps accept Feynman's commission to bring him some moss from the dragon turtle in the magic remnant area to get more information. |After completing Feynman's commission, Feynman tells you a haunted rumor. Driven by curiosity, you walked towards the ancient stele.

You met the earth spirit near the stone tablet, and the earth spirit entrusted you to remove the evil eye after the big bang and regain a key from the king of evil eye. Under the guidance of the Earth Spirit, you handed the key to Meranda, but accidentally discovered that the key and the rune could be combined. |
126|Ancient Wetland|Section 5: The Dark Palace|I thought the clues of the lost palace were interrupted again, but I didn't expect that the key in my hand was the key to opening the gate of the dark palace.

Melanda recalled that the expedition had unearthed a jagged antiquities. If you want to fully assemble this key that can open the gate of the dark palace, you must first get the jagged antiquities from Penillo. |Melanda quietly talked about the cause of the big explosion that year. Although the whole incident sounded like it was self-defeating, when you heard that the magician's soul was still imprisoned in the palace, you suddenly felt sad.

When the key turns the small hole in the stele, the entrance to the palace that has been lost for a long time opens in front of you. After learning that you have liberated the master's soul, Earth Spirit finally lifted the burden of his heart. You who brought back the golden scepter and gave it to Pannello are the real masters of adventure. |
127|The Valley of the Kings|Section 1: History of the Valley|The Guardian Village that adheres to the sacred mission, silently guards the palace of the monarch in the Valley of the Kings.

However, the relic creatures that originally guarded the monarch's palace suddenly lost their minds and began to attack the passing merchants and the guardian's village. The timid fighter Derek, after receiving the elder's order, was worrying about how to complete this task. |Just after you helped Derek complete the tasks assigned to him by the elders, you met the two elders and warriors in the village. Under their explanation, you gradually understood the difficulties they were encountering.

And Marcus, the elder who has always been exclusive, agreed to let you participate in the test of promotion to the fighter. Despite the tricky content of the test, you grabbed Camella's plan and successfully assassinated the Rat Brothers who were preparing to dig the monarch's palace and successfully promoted to a fighter. |
128|Imperial Valley|Section 2: Unknown Poisoning|When you were called by Agatha in the village, from your conversation with her, you found that the pests in the southwest were getting worse. Because of this, Agatha entrusts you to go to the vicinity of the worm den to get rid of the poisonous insects.

But Agatha still doesn't change the nature of the alchemist. She tells you that the skins of the poisonous insects are very precious alchemical materials. I hope you will bring back some insect skins for him when eradicating the poisonous insects. |Agatha has determined that there may be female worms hiding there near the wormhole. If you want to get rid of these poisonous insects, you must get rid of the female insect.

When the elder Melibela learned of the news, she immediately discussed with Yuma the method of trapping female insects. Finally, you use the trapping flower group to successfully kill the female insects. Melibela recommends that you be promoted to the warrior of the village, and this proposal was also approved by Markus. |
129|Imperial Valley|Section 3: Poisonous Wormholes|Just when everyone thought that the poisonous insect crisis had been solved, Melibela discovered that you did not slow down the reproduction of the larvae because you killed the mother worm .

Only then did she discover that the extent of the insect plague's impact had far exceeded her control. I hope you will tell this matter to the great elder Bray in the village, and ask him to find a way to solve the pest crisis. | In the judgment of the Great Elder Bray, he believes that this insect plague is definitely not a natural disaster. You follow the guidance of the great elder and go deep into the poisonous wormhole.

When you defeat the queen of worms hidden in the wormhole, the messenger behind the plague of worms will appear in front of you. Under your struggle, the Lord Envoy Jeznitta fell at your feet, and it seems that this insect plague has officially come to an end. |
130|Imperial Valley|The fourth quarter: The ambitions of the Camella Group|Ginga Baker has been planning to attack the Camella Group during this period. But the pain in his abdomen was still faintly painful, and there was really no way to deal with the Kamela Group personally.

At this time, Ginga Baker discovered that the hardness of the carapace of the Kamela Group's tortoises far exceeds that of the general tortoises, which is the main reason why the village soldiers have repeatedly defeated. In this regard, he hopes that you can bring back their carapace and perhaps find out their secrets. |You accept the entrustment of Silvery Baker, go deep into Kamela's camp, and bring back the steel scale carapace from the elite Kamela fighter. After Melibela's research, it was discovered that these carapaces were accompanied by evil dark runes.

After research by the elders, you are entrusted to knock down the Adjutant Kamela who cast this evil forbidden curse. Of course, you fulfilled this order without disappointing everyone's expectations. On the recommendation of the two elders, you took the honorable position of guardian of the village. |
131|Valley of the Kings|Section 5: The Palace of the Monarch|As the earth trembles frequently, the great elder Bray receives the warning from the ancestral spirit, and then learns that the Kamela bandit group has penetrated the tunnel of the temple of the monarch and intends to seize the temple. Holy sword. Such desecration of the Holy Land caused the anger of the Earth Spirit, and if it is not stopped, the Earth Spirit will destroy the valley.

In addition to reporting the situation to the Holy See in the first time, Bray also asks you to join forces with Silvery Baker to prevent Camilla from gaining the power of the Holy Sword, and to prevent the power of the earth from eroding the valley's creatures. |Although the plan of fighting separately allowed you to successfully get rid of Kamila's director Gong Qi Mi, Silverya Baker was ambushed by robbers at the same time. Not only did he lose all the tribal fighters, he was also seriously injured and unable to fight.

Camila took this opportunity to absorb the energy of the Holy Sword. In order to compete with him, you adopted Ginga Baker's suggestion. With the help of the ancient dragon king's guardian dragon soul, he fought to the death with Camel and successfully defeated this powerful enemy. |
132|Avila Volcano|Section 1: Volcanic Ecology|When you set foot on the Avila Volcano, you find that the residents of Yongti Village do not welcome you.

At this time, the wife of the village chief, Nanxi, suddenly called you, hoping that you can show your strength and defeat the tyrannosaurus that is hiding outside the village, to prove that you are valuable and let the villagers accept you, and perhaps also hope that you can prove that you are capable of helping the village. Residents. |Food and medical drugs in Yongti Village are on the verge of a severe shortage. You agree to help Nancy bring back turtle meat and thorn fruits, and also to retrieve the missing necklace and ring for the village chief Ida.

In order to send people to continue collecting the thorny fruits of life-saving, you accept Gallot's request, enter the thorn forest, and defeat Leo, the leader of the manticore. Your contribution to Yongti Village during this time has gradually been recognized and appreciated by the villagers. |
133|Avila Volcano|Section 2: Preparations against Fire Demons|Rumours say that ordinary weapons cannot cause damage to Fire Demons. In addition, the flames surrounding the fire demon were not something ordinary people could resist.

Therefore, Logan entrusts you to recover the geothermal coal that can raise the temperature of the furnace for him, so that he has enough materials to complete the arms that can resist the raging anger of the fire. It seems that the villagers have pinned all their hopes on Gallot. |According to Logan's commission, you hand over the geothermal coal to Antonio for processing. In the process of processing, Antonio asks you to bring some research materials back for him. This is a fair exchange.

Back in front of Logan, he thought that the fire tortoise's back armor had an excellent anti-fire effect, and when used as a shield, it would certainly be able to withstand the flames of the fire demon. After the experiments of Antonio and Winnie, it was found that only the back armor of the King of the Tortoises could be so capable. |
134|Avila Volcano|Section 3: Geothermal Fissure|Just as the preparations seemed to go smoothly, Winnie looked very panicked. Only then did you know that there is a crystal brewing volcanic energy, deeply buried under the geothermal cracks.

Judging from the research report in Winnie's hand, the power of this crystal is gradually dissipating. To the extent that science could not explain, Winnie decided to turn to the wizard Card for help. At this time, Card also seemed to have discovered this situation. |Before the energy of the Sunburning Crystal is completely dissipated, you take the three totems that Khad gave you to different locations. Under the influence of totem power, elements contaminated by evil power appear in front of you.

At Winnie's suggestion, you decide to bring this crystal to Gallot so that he can use this power to fight the fire demon. When Gallot held the crystal, a powerful force poured into Gallot's body. |
135|Avila Volcano|Section 4: The Plan to Stop the Fanatics|In the seemingly defensive war situation, the fanatics are quietly implementing a devastating project, and the imprisoned ghost in the village Guara Mara , But at this moment showed a sinister smile. No matter how Gallot interrogated, Guara Mara was unwilling to answer.

The frustrated Gallot suddenly thought of a clever plan. If he really brought back the heads of other imps and let Guaramala know how weak his life was, he might be able to ask some clues. |When you returned to Kuala Mara with the heads of the little ghosts, Kuala Mara finally let go of the plan to blow up the city of Bartello. Gallot immediately entrusts you to enter the fanatical settlement and destroy all explosives.

Just when you are trying to communicate with the fanatics, you meet the Cultist Sul who is about to escape from the fanatics' settlement. Sur said that the priests are preparing to summon the fire demon into this world, but even if you eliminate some of the priests, you still cannot prevent the fire demon from coming to Baltello. |
136|Avila Volcano|Section 5: Bartello Core|After the frightening fire demon appeared, Gallot understood that the war was near. However, no one can stop the raging fire surrounding the Fire Demon, not to mention the follow-up plan to defeat the Fire Demon.

When everyone was preparing to counterattack, Gallot quietly approached Kuala Mara. He knew that Kuala Mara had been hungry for a long time, so he planned to exchange information through food. |Guaramala, unable to stand the temptation of food, said that the only way to fight the fire demon was to start with the priest of the fire demon. You have worked so hard to obtain the anti-fire potion from the chief priest Aethas and give it to the brave Gallot.

But what was unexpected was that the anti-fire potion was basically a trap set by Guaramara, and Gallot, who drank the potion, was weak and unable to fight the fire demon. After taking over the task of getting rid of the fire demon, after a bitter battle, the fire demon was finally removed from the core of the palace. |
137|The Prairie|Section 1: Life in the Prosperous City|Bania, a wealthy businessman in Gordon, offers you a job as a mercenary. However, this job is unexpectedly simple.

Because Barnia received the order, he needed to bring back some materials from the rose beast outside Gordon to make precious medicinal materials. But this simple commission feels more like testing your abilities. |When you return to Barnia with the medicinal materials, Barnia sees that your abilities far exceed his expectations. Therefore, I decided to introduce you to the municipal high-level officials, who may be able to solve some problems for them.

At the same time, Barnia believes that if the pest infestation in the south is not resolved, it is likely to lead to a crisis in which Gordon City cannot continue to live. You replace Paladin to get rid of the insect king, temporarily solving the threat posed by poisonous insects. |
138|Prairie|Section 2: What's wrong with the mayor|Barnia is very worried about his old friend the mayor, not only is the pile of documents waiting for the mayor to deal with.

Therefore, Barnia hopes that you will discuss with Cameron for him and see if there is any way to wake up the mayor KFC who has been awake. |Cameron asks you to tell the mayor's situation to the fortune-teller Catherine. In order to repay Kakashi's kindness, Catherine hopes that you will find Kakashi's wife's lost necklace first.

After retrieving the necklace, Kakashi judged from what you told him that the mayor was cursed to sleep for a long time. At this time, Catherine gave you a magic ball. Through the power of this magic ball, you defeated the ghost that entangled the mayor. |
139|The Prairie|Section 3: The Mayor's Dreamland|I thought that after defeating the ghost entangled by the mayor, the mayor will gradually wake up.

Unexpectedly, after a period of waiting, the mayor still did not wake up from his sleep. Anxious Cameron, please go and ask Catherine again to see if there is any other way to make the mayor wake up as soon as possible. |When you put the necklace Catherine handed over to you on the mayor's neck, the power of magic leads you into the mayor's dream.

After meeting the mayor in a dream, I suddenly realized that all of this was under the influence of the dream demon. Finally, you defeated the dream monster in the mayor's dream and returned to the real world.I believe that in a short period of time, the mayor will be able to return to reality from his dream. |
140|Prairie|Section 4: Against the Wolf Eye Group|The citizens have heard word of mouth that the police force in Gordon City is in vain, and it can only behave in a big trouble.

The Chief Security Officer silently took up all the criticisms, but in the heart of the Chief Security Officer, he always hoped that one day he would regain the trust of the citizens. Therefore, the Chief of Security specifically entrusts you to weaken the Wolfeye Group's strength for them. | Mentioned from the Secretary, the herding owner Kakashi seems to know something about the Wolfeye Group. When you find Kakashi, he asks you to forward a secret letter to his old friend Thomas.

When you bid farewell to Thomas and returned to Kakashi, Kakashi was very angry with the news you brought back and the results of the investigation, and decided to teach these members of the Wolfeye Group who had changed their tone. |
141|Prairie|Section 5: Wolf Howling Hills|Because you came forward to assist the citizens of Gordon, the Wolf Eye Group lost a lot of profits, so the director Zhuo Ran Du of Wolf Eye decided to launch a comprehensive campaign against Gordon City. The attack, intends to give a good lesson to the citizens of Gordon.

And the straightforward Thomas turned this offensive plan into a small note and secretly handed it over to Kakashi to expose the devastating attack plan. |The improved long-range artillery has an effective range covering the entire Gordon City, but Hanks, the only chief instructor who knows how to operate, fell down unexpectedly when he was attacked by you. When Zhuolandu learned that the artillery attack plan had failed, he ordered his beast trainers to assemble and attack by land.

However, Zhuo Randu did not expect that all the elite troops he sent would be defeated by you. Worried about his own safety, Zhuo Landu immediately deployed the remaining manpower to his side. But in the end, Zhuo Landu still lost to your attack and fled the city in embarrassment. |
142|Endless Desert|Section 1: Discovery of the Boulder Village|The Rat Man Miner Bron, who met on the road, tells you that there are many thieves in this desert, and they often gather to attack merchants and travelers passing by.

Even daring to sneak into the village and steal the villagers' property, the behavior is very arrogant. Bron sees that you have weapons on your body, and hope you can teach the sand thieves for the villagers. |After you snatched the crystal mine back for Bron, Bron, who was worried about being scolded, asked you to give the crystal mine to Claudia. After taking over the crystal mine, Claudius formally signed a trade contract with the village chief Tarasha and the mine chief Brien.

You know from Taraxia that since Brien dug up the red crystal, stone monsters have appeared around the village. And these stone monsters attacked the village in an orderly manner, and Tarasha entrusts you to assist in the investigation and get rid of the leader of the stone man. |
143|Endless Desert|Section 2: The Infestation of Beasts and Insects|The turmoil in the beast cemetery worries the elder Thomas very much. Judging from the whole story described by Thomas, it seems that many things have been unearthed a while ago. Red crystal is related.

In order to prevent the village from being attacked by magic wing werewolves, the elders ask you to destroy them. Buy more time for the people in the village to prepare. |From the teeth of the demon-winged werewolf leader that you removed, the biologist Clifford believes that demon-winged werewolves generally eat sand-wind dead insects, and these insects are poisonous to make creatures violent.

In the judgment of the Archmage Taisala, the Abyss of Nothing is likely to be opened by the Child of Destruction. If the insect plague continues to expand, it will cause a crisis for all creatures. |
144|Endless Desert|Section 3: The Abyss of Nothing|Tesala intends to forcibly close the Abyss of Nothing to prevent the poisonous insects from coming to this world. But relying on his own mana alone, there is no way to close the passage.

She thought that the Sand God Totem that the elder Thomas was responsible for had the ability to repair the cracks in space. With this totem, the Abyss of Nothing could be closed. |Unfortunately, the Sand God Totem was looted and lost by the sand thief a long time ago, and Mucha, the garrison captain who knew about this, was also caught while investigating the sand thief camp.

After you heard Thomas's words, you sneaked into the sand thief settlement and retrieved the sand god totem. After that, Tesala poured magic power into the totem, and you entered the abyss of nothingness. After destroying all the female abyssal bugs, the abyss of nothingness is gradually closed by the charged totem. |
145|Endless Desert|Section 4: The Legend of Sand Thief and the Chamber of Secrets|In a village meeting, the village chief and elders discussed public security issues. But the village chief who insisted on not sending guards against the sand thief had his own considerations and difficulties.

With the explanation of the elder Thomas, you know that Mucha, the captain of the garrison, is the husband of Tarasha. While Muha and Wien were inadvertently captured by sand thieves while performing their usual reconnaissance mission. However, after Wien returned to the village, he refused to mention the situation that day. |You sneak into the sand thief settlement again to find Mucha who is imprisoned. Although he got the key from the sand thief cadres, he couldn't rescue Muha smoothly because of the magic enchantment. Mucha tells you that the leader of the sand thief agreed to cooperate with the son of destruction and try to break into the secret room of Amur.

When you arrive at the Amur ruins, the earth spirits appearing in front of you tell you that the son of destruction has broken into the secret room and controlled most of the Amur undead. At the request of the earth spirit, you bring the heart stone of the high priest from the tomb. |
146|Endless Desert|Section 5: Amur's Secret Chamber|Amur's land is inspired by the powerful magical energy of Taisala, please hurriedly ask you to give the time of the high priest's heart to Taisala.

The Amur Earth Spirit believes that through the powerful magic power of Taisala, the unreasonable high priest undead can be restored to normal. Before the undead have rushed out of the tomb, they must go back quickly. |When you take the heart stone of the Amur High Priest and come to Tesala. Tesara worriedly said that the Son of Destruction planned to control the undead of Amur and called for a terrorist army composed of undead.

With worry, you enter the tomb of King Amur. The Amur King who has been controlled immediately launches an attack on you. Finally, you finally defeated the controlled Amur King Spirit, and brought back the Amur King's Heart Stone to Taisala for purification. |
147|Defir's Forest|Section One: The Situation of the Forest|As soon as you entered the Dyfir Forest, you were warned by the garrison captain Blaka that you are about to face danger, and even hope you leave this green forest as soon as possible.

Under your curious inquiry, Braka said that this forest is in a state of war, and the orc mercenaries employed by the empire are cutting down trees in the forest. What's more, the orcs tried to drive the villagers out of this forest through various despicable methods. |After you drove the lily beasts around the village for Braka, the village was temporarily out of danger. The toxicity of the lily beast itself has caused many villagers to be poisoned and unconscious.

You are enthusiastic about Caruer, collecting materials for making and interpreting the serum, and defeating the lily beast that spreads violent particles. In addition, Braka also removed the violent tauren Colbert with the original violent particles in the geothermal pool. |
148|Defel's Forest|Section 2: Father's Will|The orc mercenaries hired by the empire to drive the villagers out of this forest, which made the village chief Berran, who inherited his father's will, feel very angry. Therefore, Berran intends to use poisoning as a method to poison the loggers.

In the village, only Tyson, the master of the bear-man warrior, knew how to make poison. It seems that Belland does not intend to be passive this time, so he decided to take the initiative to teach these loggers a lesson. |Just after you accepted Berran's commission, you collected a lot of poison-making materials and handed them to Tyson to make poisons.

Tyson was very angry about Bellerain's poisoning plan. In addition to asking you to teach those orc mercenaries yourself, you even want you to rebuke Belran for him. Berran, who was scolded by Tyson, regained the dignity of the bear man and decided to confront the orc head-on. |
149|Defir's Forest|Section 3: Geothermal Beast Den|The main habitat of the bull orcs, "The Geothermal Beast Den", is sealed with a great axe. Legend has it that this great axe has a powerful force. Therefore, whether this great axe falls into the hands of an orc or a violent bull orc, it will have a significant impact on the current situation.

At this time, Tyson's faintly painful old injury and Braka, who is worrying about the equipment of the garrison, make a personal request to you, making this journey even more significant. |When you enter the geothermal beast den, you defeat the raging bull orcs who injured Tyson, and from the bull orcs in the cave, you get a lot of hot iron ore that can build the armor of the garrison.

Finally, you come to the deepest part of the cave and retrieve the sealed great axe. When the great axe returned to Belran's hands, a potential crisis was finally avoided. |
150|Defir's Forest|Section 4: Defending the Temple|In the Defir Temple, a huge emerald gem "the heart of the forest" has been guarded for generations. All the grass and trees are running, relying on this emerald for a long time. And the mad scientist Pross wanted to take this gem as his own.

The ancient warrior Barobas tells you that with his power there is no way to prevent Pross from digging. He hopes that you can collect evidence from loggers and pioneers so that Buraka knows the crisis that will be encountered in the Temple of Defil. |You tell Braka the news that the ancient warrior Barobas has passed to you, and give Braka the temple amber that you snatched back from the lumberjack. Blaka guides you to Beckita, who is conducting investigations, and you may get more information.


With the assistance of Beckita and others, you have obtained important configuration maps and excavation progress reports from the camp leader. Just after Belland read the information, he began to formulate a response plan to try to prevent Pross from gaining the energy of the emerald. |
151|The Forest of De Feil|Section 5: Temple of De Feil|When Berran came up with a countermeasure, Pross has already entered the interior of the Temple of De Feil. Binida, an excavator who defected from Pross, said Pros intends to use the power of emeralds to create an army of lifeless and inanimate puppets.

In addition, the sealed giant monster was awakened by the sound of the explosion, and was looking for a way to regain freedom. And the traitor Crick, who betrayed the village of De Feil, led his workers to find something in the temple. |After you accept everyone's entrustment, you cautiously enter the Temple of De Feil. Along the way, you defeated the angry monster Nunox and the traitor Crick, and finally caught up with Pross.

However, what appeared beside him was the inanimate body that he had carefully researched. It seems that Prose's research has been successful. Finally you behead Pross, and this research secret will be sealed in this ancient temple forever. |
152|Defir Forest|Section 6: Bloodfang Fort|In order to regain the leadership of Devere Forest, reinforcements from all over the country have gathered in Devere Village. After a period of preparation and detailed planning, the horn of De Feil Village was blown again, and the counterattack against the invaders was officially launched.

With the cooperation of various strategies and plans, the orc troops began to withdraw into the fort for defense. However, how to effectively combat the orc troops stuck in the fort has become the most troublesome issue for the coalition army. |The united army has launched attacks on Bloodfang Fortress in multiple ways, and the squad led by you is even more outstanding. Not only destroyed the most threatening Gakii gunpowder, but also defeated the witch Tukatufa who participated in the war as an internal officer, and the evil fighter Chinenshuwang.

The Bloodfang Lord Gomtelo lost in the duel with you, so he had to lead his remnants out of the fortress. When he left, he vowed that he would recover the shame and would never give up. |
153|Heiyanfeng|Section 1: Forging Career|Because of the near war and the influence of the surrounding monsters, the original prosperous Hammer Town is no longer as good as it used to be. The mayor Banan Black Hammer suddenly vomited a lot of bitterness to you, the outsider who everyone has been looking forward to for a long time.

After understanding the situation here, you think that eliminating the wild owls outside the village is a good opportunity to prove your worth. If you want to know more about the current situation in Iron Hammer, you can only prove your ability to help the residents as soon as possible. |After you drive away the wild owl, Banan Black Hammer will immediately introduce you to the Clerk Tenanx of the Black Iron Guild. After you helped Tenanx get rid of the cultists who prevented the miners from working, you gradually gained the trust of the townspeople.

However, he learned from Tenanks that the real threat to their safety was a villain named Scar Jack. When you see the deliveryman in Hammer Town tragically dying under Jack's knife, you are angry and unceremoniously get rid of Jack Scar, so that he can never continue to do evil. |
154|Heiyanfeng|Section 2: Research on Special Ore|The Clerk Tenanques is faced with the pending orders all the time, and he can be said to have mixed feelings in his mind. The Black Iron Trade Union, representing Iron Hammer Town, is about to face a crisis of credit bankruptcy at this time.

Since all the weapons on the order need to be forged with Stella ore, but now that the mine is in the hands of villains, no one dares to collect them. So he hopes that you can bring back some Stella ore for him, and teach the villains who took the mine by the way. |The Stella ore that you brought back with so many hardships can only be used after being processed with other materials due to excessive impurities. Therefore, you enter the mine again and bring back cobalt crystals and other materials, allowing Knitya to forge the prototype of Starya alloy.

Knetia said that the prototype still needs some beast claws and steel horns, which can be completed by Renault for a second fusion. After you cooperated with Renault to collect the required materials, the almost perfect Starya alloy was once again presented in front of everyone. |
155|Black Flame Peak|The third quarter: The core of Stella's vein|Ternacks, who has endured for a long time, feels that the time has come and it is time to retake the pit from Stirling.

So he decided to entrust you to solve the Stirling who occupied the mine and retake the mine for the miners. But the four disciples around Stirling are not easy to deal with, so I hope you find more people to go deep into the mine together and annihilate Stirling's party members. |When you eliminated Stirling's disciples and Stirling in the mine, you regained the mayor's beloved hammer from the beast of the mine, and also brought back a lot of Rainbow Mines for Reinhardt .

The miners have a job and can go to work, I believe that in the near future, Iron Hammer Town will slowly return to life. |
156|Heiyan Peak|Section 4: The Dilemma of the Empire Command Post|After Knetia completed the equipment production, the final delivery period has been delayed for a while, and she is busy with the affairs and commissioned you to bring the goods to an empire in the north Temporary barracks.

What is curious is that there is clearly an imperial fortress in the north, so why do these knights build such a simple temporary military camp there? Could it be that they have encountered some difficulties? |From the empire's knight captain Buffy, they were originally stationed in the Axe Fortress of the Territory. Suddenly, the leader of the fortress was possessed by demons, and most of the soldiers in the fortress were also affected by evil magic. , Became very cruel.

Under Buffy's commission, you eliminated the evil spirit leader and the demon knight, and successfully weakened the lost soldiers who were controlled by evil spirits near the fortress. However, all this seemed to be just the beginning, and the matter was not over before the demon-possessed general fell. |
157|Black Flame Peak|Section 5: Cult Altar|Reinhardt, who was sent by the Knights of the Rose to investigate, collected a lot of information about the Voodoo King during this time. From the data point of view, many kidnappings and assaults were planned by him. In order to restore law and order in the Heiyanfeng area, the Voodoo King must die.

Unfortunately, although Reinhardt is very brave and good at fighting, his biggest weakness is the fear of filth in his heart. In addition, Nalia, who is struggling to find her son, and Buffy, who is trying to retake the fortress, hope that you can lend a hand to them. |The cult altar is full of disgusting sights. Along the way, you serve PakistanFei removed the obstacles on the offensive, and also found the bones of the little boy Bert and his wolf tooth necklace by the roadside. This makes you more determined to get rid of the Voodoo King.

In the deepest part of the altar, the Voodoo King stands proudly in front of you. But what Voodoo King didn't expect was that he would never have a chance to do evil again. When you return to the camp and see Nalia's sad expression, you realize that the war was not won or lost. |
158|Black Flame Peak|Section 6: Fortress - Axe of Territory|The Knights of the Toledo Empire gradually stabilized in front of the fortress, and they received supplies from Hammer Town, which boosted the morale of the soldiers. Seeing that the time for the counterattack fortress was about to come, Buffy ordered his soldiers to be ready to attack at any time.

However, the monsters in the fortress are not so easy to deal with. If it is a frontal attack, it will definitely cause great damage to the Knights. At this time, Buffy thought of a plan, but the success or failure of this plan all fell on you. |After you hand-cut the demonized Ripper Gomarok, Mineluoya's demonized brother Roxar immediately launches an attack on you. In order to fulfill Minelloya's wish, you successfully defeated the demonized Roxar and freed his soul from the demon's confinement.

But this seemingly smooth plan was soon thwarted by a large number of enchanted soldiers, and General Nierdo, who was possessed by the devil, also went to the battlefield to fight with you. Finally defeated Nierdor after a bitter battle, but the evil aura in the fortress did not abate. |
159|The Decaying Swamp|Section 1: The Crisis of the Swamp|When you come to this swamp, Arugi, the mayor of Greenmarsh Village, tells you that it is not safe here, and they are also looking forward to anyone who can help them , Lend a hand to them.

From Arugi's mouth, I learned that the rose beast, who had lived peacefully with the villagers, suddenly became agitated and aggressive for some reason. But before finding out the cause of the upheaval, the rose beasts who are ready to attack the village again must be addressed. |After you repelled the rose beast, the village chief who breathed a sigh of relief told you that the alchemist Gro once said that there is a way to detect changes in water quality. After you brought back water quality samples and collected test materials, you suddenly discovered that the water actually contains voodoo magic ingredients.

To further determine that it was the work of Voodoo, you brought Nunurak back to the Heart of the Swamp. After Nunurak's analysis, it was discovered that all of this was done by the Lizard Dragon of Youming Skeleton. |
160|Decaying Swamp|Section 2: The only remaining purified water|August, who can't stand the ghosts and gods of the villagers, said that from the information held by the Knights of the Rose, the lizard dragon in the ghostly skeleton belongs to A member of the Imperial Mercenary.

Auguste insisted on not believing in the so-called witchcraft of the gods and monsters, causing him to hit a wall everywhere in the village. Therefore, he hopes that you can forward this information to the witch doctor Nunurak on his behalf. |Under Nunurak's speculation, you go to investigate near Yongbao Mountain. From the guardian of the mountain road, a broken badge was accidentally found. And this badge clearly shows that the people who broke into the waterfall mountain are officially mercenaries of the empire.

In order to assist Nunurak in purifying the water source, you give the tube bag and amulet given to you by Kelin to August. It turned out that Nunurak hoped that August could enter the Waterfall Mountain and bring back the voodoo samples and pure water needed to purify the water source. |
161|The Decaying Swamp|Section 3: Yongbaoshan|After careful consideration, Auguste still couldn't accept the voodoo doctrine. But he tells you that imperial mercenaries sneaked into Yongbaoshan again not long ago, preparing to poison the last pure water source, and hope you can stop those imperial mercenaries for him.

After receiving the tube bag returned by August, Kelin was looking for someone to complete the task Nunurak gave her. And the alchemist Gro, seems to be very eager for the precious alchemy materials on the waterfall mountain. |You find a secret path behind Yongbao Mountain, through the path you gradually lead to the pure water source on the top of the mountain. Just before reaching the source, you see the imperial mercenaries preparing to pour the poison into their hands.

Fortunately, before they succeeded, they were driven to death by you. You put the water sample into the tube pouch, along with some red fungus mud. Despite how detailed the imperial mercenary's plan is, it still falls short in your hands. |
162|The Decaying Swamp|Section 4: The Legend of the Lord of the Earth Spirits|Arugi, the mayor of Greenmarsh Village, called you in a panic. It turned out that as a result of his divination, the huge vortex that appeared in the swamp was caused by the wrath of the ancient earth spirit king.

Aruji tells you that an adventure group came to the swamp not long ago to investigate the cause of the whirlpool. Therefore, Aruji hopes that you will ask them about the investigation. In Aruji's mind, he has been expecting that the result of his divination is not correct. |Just after Aron told everything. You grabbed a plan from the imperial mercenary. It was discovered from the plan that the lizard dragon people of the ghostly skeleton intend to poison all the residents, and even plan to control the angry earth spirit king as their puppet.

Under Nunurak's investigation, it was discovered that the evil energy poured into the vortex was emitted from the evil totem in the tribe. Therefore, you break into the Youming Skeleton Tribe, destroy those evil totems, and at the same time get rid of Azio, their chief priest. |
163|The Decaying Swamp|Section 5: Gurok's Palace|Nunurak solemnly tells you that the Lord of the Earth Spirit has been affected by the evil energy at this time and has lost his original soul, and his heart is filled with uncontrollable anger. About to break out. I hope you can enter the palace of the King of Earth Spirits and prevent this disaster from happening.

In addition, Aron, who is very worried about the adventure leader, also hopes that you can bring his teacher back. And the guardian of the gods, it seems that they have found out the function of the evil totem in the settlement of the ghost skeletons, and they all need your help. |When you enter the bedroom of the earthly king Gurok, the originally kind earthly king has completely entered the violent stage.

On this road, you will not only liberate the violent earth spirit king, but you will also wipe out the chaotic Totem Priest. Even Carlo, who became a monster, is back to normal with your help. |
164|Honor Highland|Section 1: Highland Scenery|When you are still wondering why there is a ranch on the battlefield, the hospitable Nick greets you from a distance. Nick tells you that the battle in Honor Heights does not sound very optimistic.

However, for the cheerful Nick, the iron-clad mad cow that constantly smashes the ranch fence makes him even more troublesome. For you who have just arrived in Honor Heights, helping Nick solve his troubles will enable you to better understand the situation in Honor Heights. |Just after you drove the iron-clad mad cow for Nick and collected the materials to repair the fence, James, the worker of the ranch, told you the problem that has been confusing him. From his observations during this period, he felt that there was some problem with the water quality nearby.

From the water samples, Susie saw that some evil magic power was mixed in the water. Under Susie's commission, you go to the Flying Beast Hill to get rid of the King of Flying Beasts at the source of the pollution, and bring back the materials for Susie's curse-relieving serum. |
165|Honor Heights|Section 2: Trouble of Guarding the Fort|Working on the ranch has come to an end. Nick feels that you have your ability and you shouldn't just stay in the ranch as a handyman. So Nick wrote a letter personally recommending you to his old friend Harlow the Lion.

Nick thinks that if you want to surprise Harlow, you can get rid of the Falcons betting outside the fortress. In this way, it not only proves that Nick's eyesight is still sharp, but also allows Harlow to get a competent assistant. |The Lion General Harlow is very surprised that you are holding Nick's letter of introduction and driving the Falcon outside alone. In order to test your abilities again, he orders you to kill the animal trainer who controls the lions. Of course, such a task certainly does not constitute a trouble for you.

However, the lack of supplies and the rebellion at the outpost both troubled Harlow very much. Therefore, you take back supplies from the rebels and rectify the betrayed postmaster on the spot to solve these two problems for Harlow. |
166|Honor Heights|Section 3: Federal Arsenal|In the latest battle report received by Harlow, the imperial vanguard general Kusky has led his troops to break through the federal arsenal. Currently Kusky has entered the arsenal, trying to seize the secret weapon of the Federation.

At this moment, Michelle received the spy. The rebellious owleye postmaster has given the key to the secret weapon to the imperial staff, and is now planning to hand the key to the general. In addition, Shatis, who hates the elite infantry of the Empire, is planning a revenge operation. |Under the cover of the federal army, you successfully entered the arsenal, immediately encountered an attack by the elite troops of the empire, and regained the key to the secret weapon cabinet from the staff of the empire.

Finally, you face Kusky in the deepest part of the arsenal. You defeated Kusky in this fierce battle. When you return to the Lion Fortress, Harlow, on behalf of all the Union soldiers, pays you the highest tribute. |
167|Highland of Honor|Section 4: Iron Prison - Fist of Sanction|The prison built in the lion fortress. The fist of sanctions, a few days ago, it was reported that the jailer was bought by the Toledo Empire. The rebellious warden Jedno opened all the cells, which was accompanied by a prison riot.

Although the prison guards tried their best to suppress, the large number and murderous prisoners broke through the defensive line step by step, and the entire lion fortress suddenly fell into chaos. In order to prevent the imperial army from taking advantage of the chaos and causing an unmanageable situation, General Harlow urgently ordered that the incident be strictly prohibited. |The Knights of the Rose, which has always been responsible for upholding justice, sent Jane Lonely to help suppress the riots, but it is really difficult to fight against a large number of prisoners alone, Jane Lonely has to ask you to extend a helping hand and help General Harlow to quell the riot. .

Most of the prisoners in the prison are not your opponents, but several notorious international criminals are not so easy to communicate. You had no choice but to execute their death sentence early on behalf of the judge, and this was able to quell the riot. |
168|Honor Heights|Section 5: Reappearing the Lost Magic|The Toledo Empire is very angry with the army that has lost the front line, so it has gathered a group of elite troops to prepare for a general attack on the fortress on the border of Pakistan. When the news reached Harlow, he was anxious to look for you.

He hopes that you will tell Nick's wife Susie about the current situation. He believes that Susie, who has always been calm and wise, can come up with strategies to help the federal army prepare for war. Because everyone knows that this will be a general war, a war that can never be lost. |Since the border of Basel is located in natural dangers, the only way is to use the lost advanced magic to teleport you to the fortress to support the frontline troops. However, the preparation of the magic circle is very cumbersome, so Susie also needs the assistance of Lucy and Apoda.

In the final preparations, you opened a space-time crack in the center of the ancient ruins of Tyro, and defeated the space-time monster to bring back its bones. When everything was ready, Susie began to chant the initial spell of the magic circle. |
169|Honor Heights|Section 6: Pakistani border|The news of the defeat of the Black Blood Legion made the Empire General Marshal Ironshoe Eisengler furious, and he ordered all his soldiers to immediately launch a raid on the Pakistani border. Although the Union garrison at the border was fully defending, they were still retreating steadily.

In order to break through the strong gates of the border fortresses, the Imperial Army successively attacked several defensive strongholds. The situation on the Pakistani border can be said to be precarious. After sorting out the situation on the battlefield, General Harlow can only pin his last hope on you. |The remains of soldiers can be seen lying on the ground everywhere on the battlefield. You and several brave warriors immediately joined the battle after entering the battlefield through Susie's teleportation town. But the empire's offensive was very fierce, and it was difficult to break through even with all its strength.

Fortunately, at this time, Haruou gave up the idea of ??defending the fortress and sent the remaining defenders to support you. It took a lot of hard work to successfully win the commander of the Imperial Marshal Ironhoof Eisengler camp. But this war has not really ended, Harlow sincerely hopes that the war can be quelled through diplomatic means. |

298|The Plains of Aros|Section 1: Gunsmoke all over|Milia anxiously tells you that the Breed Kingdom suddenly announced its separation from the Valencia Federation for some reason, and is preparing to enter the Toledo Empire. But this war is not good for both, so I hope you can go to the plains of Alos, where the Breed army is currently stationed, to understand the reason for the troop and find a way to eliminate the war.

Arriving at the Gorn Mountain military tunnel, it was discovered that the three crown princes of the Brade Kingdom were having a violent quarrel over the issue of dispatching troops. The Shadow Ranger Raul Tris blocked the advancement of the army and asked Princess Pei Sharosa and Prince Carombair to withdraw their troops back to the country. When the argument was still going on, a loud noise suddenly came from behind, so the prince and princess could only agree to withdraw their troops temporarily and return to investigate the source of the sound.

Go back to the station in the Plains of Alos with Prince Brad and find that there is a meteorite cave that destroys the landscape on the smooth road. You meet Raultras by the large meteorite crater. Raultras expressed his concern. It happened early, but it just happened to be able to stop the advancement of the army. He was surprised by your unique and detailed analytical ability during the process of investigating meteorites. After explaining the identity of his illegitimate child, Raul Tris asked for your help. , To persuade the prince and princess to prevent the sending of troops from the Kingdom of Brad. |After persuading, the prince and the princess thought that the occasional natural disaster like meteorites did not hinder the dispatch of troops, and laughed at Lauertras' identity and his cowardice for not daring to send troops. Raultras was very angry and aggressive. He fought with the two of them and stunned them with a strange force, but he immediately found himself too impulsive and felt ashamed. These were all seen in the eyes of the Breeder King Monette who had just arrived at the barracks, and he angrily reprimanded him. Altris surpassed his duty and removed him from the camp after he was removed from the ranks. He also scolded the prince and princess for ordering troops before he gave the order.

King Monette was not surprised by your visit. He expressed firm determination to attack the Toledo Empire, but he did not want to say the reason for the war. If you think about it, maybe you can get information from the barracks so that you can know the real reason for the Breed Kingdom to send troops. |
299|The Plains of Aloth|Section 2: The Threat of the Royal Family|From the Breed Guard Zorlu, I learned that the reason for sending troops seems to be related to the king, plus the clues leaked by the gossip female aristocrat Lorraine and the merchant Kant, you Know the real reason.

It turned out that the Queen of Brad was taken away a few days ago, and only the provocative letters of the Toledo Empire were left at the scene. This made the kingdom of Brade discredited, so King Monette was reluctant to disclose the details and insisted on it. Attacked the Toledo Empire, but then thought that this was unlikely to be the Toledo Empire's actions, because all the troops of the Toledo Empire had been fully invested in the battle against the Son of Destruction and could no longer establish other enemies, so you decide Meet the king again, hoping to explain to the king the current situation of the Toledo Empire.

When you enter the barracks to persuade the king again, suddenly a woman in Toledo's military uniform appears and uses a strange force to restrain everyone in the barracks. King Monette seems to know who she is. She agreed that the king voluntarily followed her without hurting others. |You feel a great power in the person who took the king away, but the source of this power is unprecedented. Even the most powerful mage in Toledo cannot achieve this power, but these Suspicious points can't convince the angry prince and princess, it seems imperative to enter Toledo.

At the same time, Princess Pei Sharosa keenly discovered the power used by the female Toledo, which seemed to be very similar to the power used by Raul Tris before. The sceptical prince and princess decided to send a part of the soldiers to Raul Tris. Catch it back for a good interrogation.

Under the description of the Brad guard Zorlu, you found Raultras the first step and explained that King Monnet was taken away. Raultras was taken aback. He said that this series of events was related to him. It was to prevent certain things from happening, but now some terrible changes have taken place, Raul Tris worriedly asks for your help again. |
300|The Plains of Aros|Section 3: Outsider Meteorite|In order to explore the actual condition of the meteorite, you and Raultras entered the meteorite crater from one side. You clear the monsters while moving toward the depths of the crater. When he encountered an abnormally ferocious alien creature in the deepest part, a mysterious man suddenly appeared and killed the monster.

The mysterious man asks you to fight against him, and after you win, he will explain everything about the meteorite. Just before victory is about to be won, the mysterious man releases the same power as the one who took the king before, and is surprised by the strange power. As you attacked, you struggled hard. With your life threatened, you gradually felt that the scope of your activities was getting wider and wider. When you were able to resume your actions, you didn't expect the mysterious man to stop immediately, and Raul Triss Also appeared from behind at this time. |Raultras explained to you that this mysterious man is his companion-Frederi, who is also a member of the "Watchmen" organization. Frederic said that he would attack you because he wanted you to be able to To understand the method of fighting against the "power of the other world", as long as the stronger the will, the less the influence of the power of the other world will be.

Although Raultras and Frederic have not explained clearly, the whereabouts of the king is currently the most important thing. After investigating the information separately, Frederic will tell you that you have a general idea, and the king is hidden. In a cave in the deep shade forest, in order to find out the exact location of the cave, Frederi gave you a device that can sense the power of another world, and asks you not to act rashly after discovering the king, because the enemy Possess a very powerful power in another world. |
301|The Plains of Aloth|Section 4: Stuck in a stalemate|I came to the depths of Gorn Mountain through the device given by Frederi, but encountered Raultras fighting with unknown magical creatures and assisted Raultras to solve it After the magical creatures, an anxious member of the Watchmen organization appeared and told Raultras that the princess and the prince asked the army to march in the absence of food. The army is now assembled and ready to go.

The anxious Raultras forces herself to calm down and think about the solution. You also think about it, trying to find out the clues from the chaotic clues. You haven't come to a conclusion yet. Raultras, who is determined, hopes you can go together. Military tunnels prevent the army from advancing.

When the two arrived at the military tunnel, they found that the army had begun to march. Fortunately, the prince and princess were found at the forefront of the army. Raultras began to think of ways to persuade the prince and princess to stop marching. |But the prince and the princess still insisted on sending their troops forward. Seeing that Raultras was unable to stop him, he unleashed the power of another world to restrain the prince and princess and the soldiers in the tunnel. But the prince who had experienced this power before Suddenly at the same time as the princess broke free of this power, they angrily denounced Raul Tris, who was too weak because of the power, as a traitor.

Just as the prince and the prince further impose military law on Raultras, the intuition in your mind tells you that you can't let him die here, and step forward to stand in front of Raultras. It's a pity that the prince and the princess have no cooperation. Under the idle offensive, you were defeated steadily. Fortunately, they didn't want to hurt you. At this moment, Raul Tris used the last bit of strength to teleport the two out of the military tunnel.

The two who survived the catastrophe do not have to worry about sending troops for the time being. Although they have become betrayers in everyone's mouth, Raul Tris, who still considers the overall situation, hopes that you will continue to find the whereabouts of the king, and he will also come back when his strength is restored. Then catch up.

Going back to Gorn Mountain, I saw Frederi and explained the situation of Raul Tris. After a bit of sigh, Frederi said that it was not a big problem for him to just get out of his power, but he was supposed to rescue the king himself. , I will trouble you to replace it. |
302|The Plains of Aloth|Section 5: The Ghost of the Ancient Kingdom|Fredery said that he will enter the cave with you, and remove all obstacles as much as possible. You only need to focus on moving forward to find the living king.

Soon after entering the cave, they were attacked by a squad wearing Toledo soldier clothes. Each of them would use the power of another world. Frederi and the members of the Watchmen organization contained these fake Toledo soldiers. So that you can go to the depths of the cave to find the king. After knocking down the invading magic stone guard, you unexpectedly met the missing Queen Brad, Elaine, and she strongly asked you to hurry up and save the life of the king with her.

Escorting the queen all the way to the depths of the cave, the figure of a man suddenly appeared. After careful investigation, it was indeed King Monette. Suddenly the queen behind used a powerful otherworldly force to imprison you. I thought it was Queen Elean's. The woman was shrouded in weird light, and then showed her true face. It turned out that she was Sidana, the king's old lover.

As a survivor of the ancient kingdom, Sidana not only killed the queen and pretended to be her. This series of things happened because someone promised to help her clan and return to this world after a thousand years of drifting, and she personally took Monet away. King Te is to be able to live with the king after the destruction of the Breed Kingdom. Just when Sidana was about to kill the killer, Raul Tris just arrived at this time. He blocked the attack and relieved you. Imprisoned. |Sidana, who is also a survivor of the ancient kingdom, was very angry at her son's repeated sabotage plan. She released a powerful force to knock him aside. At this time, you broke free from the imprisonment imposed on you by the strength of your body. She stepped forward and attacked Sidana, and fought for a while, when the energy that enveloped Sidana suddenly disappeared out of nowhere, she made a painful sound and then fell weakly, and the power of the other world that bound the king and Raul Tris was also affected. Dissipated without a trace at this time.

Sidana who fell to the ground seemed to gradually regain her senses. The expression of regret and the words full of guilt caused King Monette to hold Sidana, who was slowly disintegrating in shape, to weep bitterly. Raul Tres lowered her head without saying a word, and you immediately found that he was right. Shaking slightly.

Under King Monnet's inquiry, Raul Tris explained the ins and outs of the incident. What happened recently was done by aliens who wanted to draw the Brad's army out of the city of Philly Hayward. They disguised themselves as Toledo. The empire does various provocative actions, while the meteorite is a small island that loses power and falls when traveling through space. The Watchmen organization is established by Raultras hoping to rely on his own power to prevent these things from happening, and the original The floating island drifting in another world is about to land in the city of Philip Hayward, which is an unprecedented devastating attack.

After knowing the cause of the matter, the king decided to go back and mobilize the army to prevent aliens from calling the floating island circle in the city. He also asked Raultras and the watchmen organization to immediately find a way to board the floating continent and ask you to return together. The city of Philip Hayward prevents the landing plan of the floating island. |

This is a true story that once caused a sensationAt that time, the image of the military was even more frustrated. |"In the year that happened, the newly enlisted soldier had an outstanding young man named Ollie Foss. He was a smart man with good abilities and wrists, and he was motivated. He quickly stood out and was promoted to the ranks. It can even be said to be the general's confidant and beloved general.

However, the rapid promotion made some veterans have a sense of crisis. They attacked him everywhere in public affairs, and even united with the soldiers in the barracks to exclude him, and even spread rumors that his rank was obtained by disgraceful means.

Ollie didn't pay much attention to it at first, but the frequent small movements and malicious harassment forced him to resist. As a result, life was even more sad, and finally it turned into an irreversible tragedy..."

305|Felihavor City|Section 1: Meteorite Strikes the City|After the incident in the Plain of Aros is over, the king immediately brought his army back to the city of Filihavor, and you also rushed there. Unexpectedly, the attack had already begun. The city of Ferry Hayward had already been sealed off, and the Brad's army was trying its best to rescue the residents of the city from the clutches of alien creatures.

King Monette worriedly explained the current situation. The city has been baptized by meteorites and otherworldly monsters, and the city gate has also been sealed by unknown forces and cannot be opened. He is currently assisting the defenders in finding a way to open the city gate, the prince The princess and Raultras have entered the city through the underground waterway to assist the defenders and ensure the escape route for the people. The king hopes that you can join them.

I found the castle defense captain Zhuo An at the entrance of the underground waterway. The captain was very happy about your arrival, but the monsters from the other world seemed to have been ordered to attack here. I hope you can help attack the nearby alien flying beasts landing point. Relieve their pressure.

After suspending the flying beast's offensive, Captain Zhuo'an was worried about the current situation in the city but was unable to leave here, so he hoped that the player could enter the city as soon as possible to assist Commander Boros. |After you pass the sewer, you immediately see that the town defenders are being attacked by waves of alien monsters, but they are still working hard to clear the way for the people to take refuge.

You immediately find Commander Boros. He said that it is already very difficult to defend the camp, but there are still villagers who are trapped in the house by monsters and dare not come out. Please destroy the monsters that linger outside the house and make them trapped. Residents in the house can escape smoothly.

After destroying the monsters outside the house, Commander Boros explained that the residents who had just escaped provided important information. The monsters all appeared from a certain area in the civilian area of ??the city. He hoped that the player could break through the siege and destroy the summoned monsters. Manipulator.

When you arrived at the target, you found the wounded soldier and the alien leader, Raul Tris also rushed to the scene and eliminated the alien leader with you, but the wounded soldier next to you did not appreciate it and called Raul Tris excitedly. As his aliens got out of the castle, Raultras was silent and walked out lonely after telling you to take care of these soldiers.

You go back and tell the commander Boros the good news about the completion of the mission, and ask the commander to send someone to bring the wounded soldiers back. The commander is very happy about this and hurriedly sends someone to pick up the wounded soldiers. |
306|Philip Hayward City|Section 2: Recapture of the Dangerous City|Commander Boros explains to you that Princess Pei Sharosa is currently using a private house as a stronghold, hoping to find a way to stop the monsters, you can find it according to the intelligence For the princess in the house, the princess expressed gratitude and apologized for what happened before. You can feel from the dialogue that the princess is still full of resentment towards Raul Tris.

The information provided by Princess Pei Sharosa pointed out that the magical rituals of aliens were found in the city. The aliens seemed to use this circle to summon meteorites to descend. They are currently deploying an attack. After confirming that you are willing to assist, she Include you as part of the attack, hoping to stop the crisis.

With your assistance, many magic circles were successfully destroyed. After returning to the agreed place to meet the princess, the princess said that when the largest summoning circle was destroyed, it was too late for the famous alien to shout loudly before he died. .

Although Princess Pei Sharosa is worried about the words of the alien before his death, the meteorite giants currently wandering in the city are more threatening and hope you can help clear these giants. |After you wiped out the meteorite giant, you found that many soldiers were lying on the ground bored, and asked a soldier with a relatively minor injury. It turned out that there was a huge meteorite giant who was driven by an alien to go higher. And they seem to be planning something. The soldiers ask you to stop them as soon as possible.

After working hard to solve the giant meteorite giant, he returned to Princess Pei Sharosa's place and was explaining the situation to the princess. The princess also informed the situation of Prince Karumbair in the noble area, but Raultras suddenly appeared outside the house. .

Although King Monette had explained Raultras' situation to the princess and prince, the princess still did not trust him. Raultras, who was angry about this, left the highest point in the city as the real summoning ceremony. After the decoy's important information, he left without looking back.

Although you are very concerned about the information Raul Tris brings, after the princess's inquiry, you still decide to see what Prince Carumbair has found in the noble district. |
307|Philip Hayward City|Section Three: Destruction Coming again|Just as he was getting ready to set off, the soldiers monitoring outside the house suddenly sounded an alarm. The aliens have surrounded here, and the angry Princess Pei Sharosa thought these aliens The people were sent by Raultras. After declaring war loudly on the aliens, they learned from the alien population that they were hunting down Raultras, so they tracked down here.

After defeating the aliens who surrounded the house, the princess fell into confusion and panic. She felt emotional about Raul Tris, who was also the heir of the king but his mother killed the queen, and the status of an alien who was hunted by aliens. The chaos, fortunately, gradually stabilized under your comfort.

The princess expressed her unwillingness to give up the wounded soldiers who had just gone through the battle. She hopes that you will go to the noble district to find Prince Karumbaer. When you find the prince, he is surprised that you are the only one. They have found the real ceremony location in the Senate, but the aliens have sealed the scene with the power of the alien world. Only you, the princess and himself can resist the power of the alien world. He believes that the princess can arrive in time. So I hope to start the action now and gather in the Senate after the soldiers help clear the way. |After the soldiers paid the tragic casualties and cleared the way, you entered the Senate. Prince Karumbair had arrived. Not long after, Princess Pei Sharosa also rushed to the scene. The three of them marched to the main hall of the Senate, but they saw Raultras and the members of the Wardens organization lay on the ground covered in scars. You hurriedly stepped forward to confirm Raultras' condition. Fortunately, he is still alive, but the magic remaining from the wound on his body makes you feel Familiar, this seems to be the power of the red crystal that symbolizes destruction.

Suddenly, the prince stared at the dark corner as if feeling something, and in a burst of arrogant laughter, Tropharam, the son of destruction, walked out of the darkness.

Troframu released the destructive energy of the other world to imprison you. After arrogantly announcing that he would use the falling floating island to destroy the castle, he opened the portal and took away the dying Raul Tri. Syang walked away, leaving behind an unknown monster that he had never seen before.

When desperate, you suddenly felt an unusually familiar wave in the depths of your consciousness. You touched that power in your heart without thinking about it. The power of the blue crystal, which symbolizes hope, instantly fills your body and is absorbing it. After imprisoning your outside world energy, you are swollen out, you use this power to repel unknown monsters, and lift the imprisonment of the prince and princess.

Returning to the stronghold in the noble quarter, King Monette has learned from the prince and princess about the series of things that just happened.

Going to explore, the surviving members of the Watchmen organization will also go to the mainland to assist.

After arriving at the sky island, the members of the watchmen have cleared a temporary stronghold on the edge of the mainland. Raul Tris said that the aliens who originally lived on the mainland were in a state of madness, and since stepping on this land, they have felt There is an inciting force in the air that is affecting the minds of people who hold otherworldly powers, so the members of the watchmen can only concentrate on defense and give you a special device that can sense huge energy fluctuations. Please look for it through it. Where the signal is strongest, that should be the location of the floating device.

After discovering the real purpose of the advocates, the situation has lost control, and there is a crazy smell everywhere. The queen ordered all the normal people to hide in the palace and asked Yixu Maichuang to retrieve the artifacts that sealed the palace, but when he returned to the palace, the queen had already used her own power to use the palace in a weaker way.

You will briefly explain to the queen what happened after you boarded the floating continent. The queen said that although Trofalam had gone to the Holy Land in Dorrent, he would encounter great obstacles there, and we must also bring With the surviving people of Dorrent heading to the Holy Land, where the crazy factor can be relieved from them. |
313|The Ancient Kingdom of Dorrent|Section 4: Holy Land of the Sky|You came to the Holy Land through the teleportation rune imposed by Queen Dorent. It was once the house where the guards of the Holy Land lived. Now it has become the survivors of the Magic Kingdom of Dorrent The place of refuge, the whole camp was filled with sadness and despair.

At the Queen's request, in order to heal the Dorrents who have fallen into madness, you obtain the Flawless Pure Crystal from near the Prayer Terrace and bring them back to the camp. After the Queen uses the Flawless Pure Crystal to heal the tribe, you ask her how to repair the floating device After a period of thinking, the queen made up his mind to hand you a crystal ball. It turned out that in order to restore the power of floating, you must use this crystal ball to draw the power of the otherworld from the Dorrent, but she fell into Crazy Dorrents may lose resistance and be assimilated into monsters. With only this method, the queen had to make this decision.

Unexpectedly, when you use the crystal ball to divert the energy of the outside world from the Dorrents, that crazy breath will also escape from your body. After you have enough energy, you will return to the camp. The queen knows After the news, tears were shed with excitement, and the Dorrent people in the entire camp also exuded hopeful vitality. |You and the sober Dorrents used crystal balls separately to restore the power of the floating device. When you returned to the camp, you learned the news of worry from the queen. Raul Tris suddenly woke up and ignored his physical weakness. Leaving the door without a word, Queen Dorent guessed that Raul Tres should be heading to Alnafellow, but to enter Alnafellow without the help of Pegasus, it would take a day to walk from the floating ladder. , You didn't know where to find Pegasus for a while, so you had to go to the floating light ladder to see the situation first.

After arriving at the Floating Light Ladder, you immediately find Raultres's Pegasus neighing quietly beside the Floating Light Ladder, and there is a lot of blood on your body. You, worried about the situation, reached Al Nafello through the Pegasus, along After the blood on the road went deep, you found the weak Raultras on the side of the road.

Judging by his fierce breathing and vain movements, his body has not recovered from the cruel torture of Troframu. Despite this, he has still cut down a considerable group of monsters, but this may be what he is now The limit can be reached. |
314|The Ancient Kingdom of Dorrent|Section 5: Fearless Sacrifice|The weak Raultras tells you that when he was controlled by Troframu, he also spied his inner plan.

Going alone to stop Trofalam, you are blocked by the huge goddess statue. You can feel the concentration of pure energy and the unprecedented deep evil in the space behind it at the same time, although the goddess statue does not emit any Dark power, but you can't pass his barrier either.

At this moment, the statue of the goddess suddenly cracked and the barrier disappeared, but an evil force far stronger than what you had just noticed was shot out unscrupulously, making you barely able to use your trembling legs. Support your body.

In the arrogant laugh and words of Trofalam from the front, you learned that the goddess was the last barrier guarding the core, just damaged in the hands of the son of destruction. You suppressed the anxiety in your heart and clenched tightly. Weapons, teeth bite to the front are waiting for your fate to go. |Troframu seems to have known that you will come, leading other children of destruction to attack you, after fierce battle, defeated other children of destruction, but Troframu, who has absorbed part of the core power, released a A terrible force of destruction is weighing on you, pressing you on the ground and unable to move. Troframu said that in order to reward you for repeatedly obstructing their plans, you should make you suffer in purgatory for your body, soul, and soul, and you cannot escape. , Then used energy to open the door of purgatory.

Just when he fell into despair, a figure suddenly rushed out, and the awakened Raul Tris inspired the remaining life energy to crash into Troframu. You can see from his face that he is ready to sacrifice. , Accompanied by Troframu's unwilling scream, crashed into the gate of purgatory.

You look at the remaining weapons of Raul Tris through your tears, and feel discouraged by your own weakness, step forward to pull Raul Tris's sword, and a strong feeling overflows from your heart in an instant, making you temporarily Forget about the sadness, and once again understand what I should do next as a son of eternity.

After losing the source of summoning them, the alien monsters finally stopped increasing, allowing the defenders of Felihewo to control the situation smoothly. You told Mo about Raultras' sword and the things in El Nafellow. King Nett and Queen Dorrent, this war with the Son of Destruction is finally over, but the price paid is unbearable. You swear to the sadness in your heart that you will make yourself stronger, never Let this happen again. |
